They must have written documentation, such as a doctor’s note, supporting any accommodation that allows an employee to not wear a face covering. The order also includes additional guidance around the wearing of face coverings in restaurants and gyms.     In restaurants, Delawareans and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings when waitstaff visits a table, and whenever they are not eating or drinking. Customers must wear coverings if they leave their table and while entering or exiting the establishment.     In gyms and other exercise facilities, Delawareans must wear face coverings when they are not engaged in vigorous physical activity. Vigorous physical activity – or high-intensity exercise – is defined as a physical activity done with a large amount of effort, resulting in a substantially higher heart rate and rapid breathing. Delawareans must wear face coverings while weight-lifting, which is not considered vigorous physical activity, and everyone is strongly encouraged to wear face coverings at all times in gyms.     According to the updated order, bars in Delaware beach communities may reopen on Friday (4th Sep) for food service with significant safety precautions. Reservations are required for bar service, and food must be ordered. Patrons must maintain six (6) feet social distance from non-household members.    Since all closure restrictions seem to have been dialed down to a social distancing/mask wearing restriction, and the bars on the beach communities are also allowed to reopen - the code is changed to a 1G.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200904125722/https://news.delaware.gov/2020/09/03/governor-carney-issues-omnibus-executive-order-on-covid-19-restrictions/"
