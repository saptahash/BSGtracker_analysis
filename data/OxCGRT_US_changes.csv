On the Florida Health website, public information resources are still available to download and disseminate to communities online and in person, but announcements have appeared to become infrequent. This necessitates a code change from 2G to 2T as local-level public health campaign announcements seem to have a much higher frequency than national level.     Miami-Dade County Office of Emergency Management posts material reminding park visitors to engage in social distancing in parks, wearing mask, and limiting group size to 10 people. Palm Beach County also posts updates to COVID-19 updates on their Twitter pages.

"1102","Nebraska","US_NE","01-Oct","H1_Public.information.campaigns",1,"G",1,"G","On October 1, the Nebraska of Health and Human Services published the ollowing 7 tips are adapted from The American Psychological Association (“Check Out the Stress Tip Sheet,” 2018) to support individuals with a stress management plan:  Understand your stress: How do you stress? It can be different for everybody. By understanding what stress looks like for you, you can be better prepared, and reach for your stress management toolbox when needed.  Identify your stress sources: What causes you to be stressed? Be it work, family, change or any of the other potential thousand triggers.  Learn to recognize stress signals: We all process stress differently so it’s important to be aware of your individual stress symptoms. What are your internal alarm bells? Low tolerance, headaches, stomach pains or a combination?  Recognize your stress strategies: What is your go-to tactic for calming down? These can be behaviors learned over years and sometimes aren’t the healthy option. For example, some people cope with stress by self-medicating with alcohol or overeating.  Implement healthy stress management strategies: It’s good to be mindful of any current unhealthy coping behaviors so you can switch them out for a healthy option. For example, if overeating is your current go to, you could practice meditation instead, or make a decision to phone a friend to chat through your situation. The American Psychological Association suggest that switching out one behavior at a time is most effective in creating positive change.  Make self-care a priority: When we make time for ourselves, we put our well-being before others. This can feel selfish to start, but it is like the airplane analogy—we must put our own oxygen mask on before we can assist others. The simplest things that promote well-being, such as enough sleep, food, downtime, and exercise are often the ones overlooked.Self-care is group-care.   Ask for support when needed: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, reach out to a friend or family member you can talk to. Speaking with a healthcare professional can also reduce stress, and help us learn healthier coping strategies.

Kristi Noem’s position of casting doubt on the efficacy of wearing face coverings in public.    As the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have multiplied in recent weeks, the Republican governor has tried to downplay the severity of the virus, highlighting that most people don’t die from COVID-19. Noem, who has staked out a reputation on refusing to issue any mandates to stem the virus’ spread, has repeatedly countered recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to wear masks in public settings.    Shortly after the Department of Health reported that the number of hospitalizations from COVID-19 broke records for the third straight day on Tuesday, people who represent doctors, nurses, hospitals, school administrators and businesses huddled to promote mask-wearing, social distancing and handwashing. They warned the state’s hospitals could face a tipping point in their ability to care for COVID-19 patients.    “Masking is a simple act that each one of us can participate in and it can save lives,” said Dr. Benjamin Aaker, the president of the South Dakota State Medical Association. “If you mask, that life could be your mother, father, your friend, or even your own.”    Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury noted that the governor does not oppose all mask-wearing, but is trying to promote a “nuanced” approach to masks. She has said it is appropriate to wear masks around people with symptoms of COVID-19 or in hospitals. But she has not encouraged people to wear face coverings in public, as recommended by the CDC.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201029211751/https://time.com/5904744/south-dakota-masks-covid-19/"
