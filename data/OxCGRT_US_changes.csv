We also kept a keen eye on our most important factor—the safety of our faculty, staff, and students.

Most Midwest universities saw enrollment drops, especially among incoming freshmen, first-generation college students, and ethnic minorities.  The University of Nebraska had growth in all of those areas.  We held off on tuition rate increases for two years.   We took our online course cost per credit hour down significantly.   Enrollment in our distance-online programs grew by almost 10% over the past year, even with in-person education.  We made changes to the academic calendar to finish coursework and exams in Lincoln by Thanksgiving.  In Omaha and Kearney, students are finishing exams, mostly through remote learning.  We’re bringing students back to campus in Lincoln and Kearney in late January rather than in early January.

Specifically, following the implementation of the state’s “surge and flex” program, if a region’s 7-day average hospitalization growth rate shows that the region will reach 90% within the next 3 weeks, the region will become a Red Zone.    NEW: Following updated guidance from the CDC, if a region's hospitalization rate does not stabilize by December 12, additional restrictions will be applied to indoor dining. If the hospitalization rate does not stabilize in New York City by December 12, indoor dining will be suspended; if the rate does not stabilize in regions outside New York City, capacity restrictions will be reduced to 25 percent.

The new recommendations shorten the window for quarantine.    For those with a close contact exposure to someone with COVID-19 or anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, quarantine is recommended to limit opportunities for virus transmission to others.    Effective today, quarantine can end after seven (7) days since a COVID-19 close contact only if all of the following conditions have been met:    The person seeks a COVID-19 test on day five (5) following their exposure to another person testing positive and their test is negative.  The person is not experiencing symptoms.  The person continues to self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and wears a mask through day 14.  For those who’ve had a close contact exposure to COVID-19 but don’t take a test, quarantine can end when all of the following conditions have been met:    At least 10 days have passed since close contact exposure.  No COVID-19 symptoms have developed.  The person continues to self-monitor for symptoms, and wears a facial covering through day 14.

Travelers from COVID-19 lower-risk States are not required to fill out the Massachusetts Travel Form and do not need to quarantine. DPH's metric for determining lower-risk states for the purposes of Massachusetts’ interstate travel policy considers data over two weeks before moving a state from lower risk to high risk. One week of data is the standard for moving states into the lower risk category. Additionally, the threshold of daily cases per 100,000 residents is 10 (which ensures that Massachusetts’ standard is in line with other states). States are included on the “lower-risk” list based on meeting two criteria: average daily cases per 100K below 10 AND positive test rate below 5%, both measured as a 7-day rolling average.

The relief payment is meant to assist unemployed Maine people at a time when they continue to face substantial economic hardship as a result of COVID-19 [...] This payment includes self-employed, sole proprietors, and other business owners who are unemployed and losing their Federal unemployment benefits this month.    Commissioner Fortman estimates that up to 42,000 Maine people will be eligible for the payment, which uses $25.2 million in CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Funds. “The one-time payment, which is not an unemployment benefit, will be distributed to those who are unemployed or partially unemployed due to COVID-19.”     Given this information about the policy, and given Maine’s median monthly income is around $4500, this indicator is coded at 1A.

These include Electric, Natural Gas, Water, Wastewater, Telecommunication, Steam.     However, effective November 9, 2020, the PUC has adopted new safeguards for “protected customers” – those residential households hardest hit by the economic downturn triggered by COVID-19, along with aid for small businesses.   With these enhanced safeguards in place for struggling households and small businesses, the PUC’s emergency moratorium on all other utility terminations will be lifted, effective Nov. 9, 2020.   This applies to all electric, natural gas, water, wastewater, telecommunications, and steam utilities subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction.     - No Terminations for “Protected Customers” – Utilities shall not terminate service for residential customers with incomes within 300% of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines (FPIG), unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. These “protected customers” must apply for all available assistance programs and must request a payment arrangement from the utility, if appropriate.    - Special Outreach to Customers At-Risk of Termination – Utilities must reach out to individual residential and commercial customers whose unpaid balances put them at-risk of termination after the PUC moratorium is lifted, detailing their options for addressing any overdue balances and a general time range for possible termination. This communication must be sent to customers at least 10 days prior to the traditional 10-day termination notice.    - Payment Arrangements for Small Businesses – Utilities shall offer a payment arrangement for a period of no less than 18 months to small business customers, as defined by a utility’s tariff. A small business customer who remains current on its payment arrangement and current bill shall not be terminated.    - Waiver of Connection/Reconnection Fees – Utilities shall waive all connection, reconnection and deposit fees for protected customers.    - No Late Payment Charges – Late payment charges are waived for protected customers.    - Additional Medical Certificates – Two additional medical certificates shall be accepted by utilities for eligible customers who have exhausted the number otherwise available, with an additional seven days for medical professionals to return medical certificates to the utility.    - Flexible Income Verification – Utilities and the PUC’s Bureau of Consumer Services can utilize flexible methods to verify customer income for assistance programs, payment plans and qualification as a protected customer – such as over-the-phone or email.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201104204014/https://www.puc.pa.gov/press-release/2020/puc-enhances-utility-protections-for-families-businesses-struggling-with-financial-impact-of-covid-19    https://web.archive.org/web/20201123074225/https://www.pa.gov/guides/responding-to-covid-19/#ForIndividuals"

Get your flu shot until you can get your COVID-19 vaccine.    National Influenza Vaccination Week, which is being observed December 6th to 12th, is a nationwide call to action to encourage those who have not already done so to get their annual flu shot. Every year, flu is responsible for millions of illnesses, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and thousands of deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that during the 2019-2020 flu season, vaccinations prevented 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations and 6,300 deaths due to influenza.

That is especially true as we are living through this pandemic.  Loneliness is a feeling of being alone regardless of the amount of social contact.  Social isolation is a lack of social connection.  We can have many social connections but still feel lonely.  Loneliness and feeling disconnected can exacerbate our thoughts, feelings, behaviors, mood, anxiety, and depression.  We need to manage expectations this holiday season.  Embrace the imperfect to improve your mental health.  Identify those things which you do not have control over and do the best you can with the resources available to you.  Remind yourself that everyone is in an unusual situation with limited resources.  Calls, drawings, notes, pictures, and notes of thanks just cost a little time.  Make self-care a priority.  During this difficult time, be sure to sleep, exercise, and get good nutrition.  This can contribute to your mental health.  Reach out to your local community service organizations and faith-based organizations to get involved.  Giving to others changes your brain.  There’s an actual physiological benefit when you give to another person.  This year’s celebrations will certainly look different than those in years past, but with a little creativity, holiday celebrations can still be meaningful this year.  Consider using a video conference service such as Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime to carry out your traditions.  Pick up your phone and call someone you haven’t spoken to in a while.  Your call might make someone else’s day as well as your own.  We need each other for support.   It is ok to ask for help.  If you need to talk or get immediate help in a crisis, please call the Nebraska Family Helpline at (888) 866-8660.    The helpline can connect you to behavioral health providers in your community.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201221202550/https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-highlights-advent-season-importance-behavioral-health-vaccinations-begin"

This season is traditionally very challenging in terms of maintaining adequate blood supplies in our state and country.    This is due to the holidays; winter weather; and the prevalence of cold, flu, and other seasonal illnesses in the community.  We’re asking Nebraskans to step up to donate blood and sponsor blood drives.  A shortage of blood may affect people who need emergency surgery, victims of accidents, and cancer patients in need of periodic transfusion.  One single blood donation can potentially save three lives.  The pandemic has caused the cancellation of many blood drives.  In Nebraska alone, we’ve seen over 1,300 blood drives cancelled since the beginning of the pandemic, leading to the projected loss of around 35,000 units of collected blood.  Blood drives are conducted with the highest standards of safety and infection control.  All staff and donors are subjected to health screenings, everyone wears a mask during the process, social distancing is maintained, and there’s an aggressive program of disinfection at each collection station.  The American Red Cross tests all blood donations for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  Individuals interested in donating blood are encouraged to go to redcross.org and make an appointment to donate.  Appointments are required in order to maintain social distancing.  Organizations interested in sponsoring a blood drive can also submit an application on the website.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201221205435/https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-highlights-start-coronavirus-vaccinations-calls-nebraskans-donate-blood"

Contact tracing is an important tool to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  As a reminder, contact tracing is a confidential process that starts with a positive test result being reported to the state or local health department.  Next, a trained contact tracer calls the person who received a positive test result and asks them a series of questions about what symptoms they may be experiencing.   The contact tracer also asks if they know where and when they were exposed, as well as who they were in close contact with during the few days prior to their symptom onset or positive test result.  Due to the rise in coronavirus cases, contact tracers are dealing with a high volume of work.  To most efficiently manage the workload, we’ve taken the following temporary measures:  Reducing the questions asked during the interview.  Reducing the number of call attempts from five to two.  Focusing on calling those who test positive for the coronavirus.  We’ve temporarily suspended calling close contacts of positive cases.  We’re asking people who’ve tested positive to notify their close contacts.  We are also increasing contact tracing staff.  We’re activating our DHHS reserve contact tracers who had performed this work earlier in the year.  We’re also working with PRC, Nelnet, and North End Teleservices to add additional contact tracers.

Due to limited COVID-19 vaccines, immunization programs have been encouraged to utilize a phased approach to vaccine allocation.  It’s vitally important that those on the frontlines in the fight against the pandemic stay as healthy as possible and that we reduce their chances of spreading this virus.  This is why the first allocations will focus on healthcare personnel.  Groups prioritized for vaccination can be found in the State of Nebraska COVID-19 Vaccination Plan and are subject to further clarification and prioritization by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  Another critical component that we have been working on is creating the proper infrastructure for data transmission.  Our program focus is on COVID-19 product logistics with manufacturers and commercial partners that are part of CDC’s centralized COVID-19 vaccine delivery system.  The Nebraska State Immunization Information System (NESIIS) is equipped to receive vaccine administration data and is prepared to transmit de-identified vaccination data to the CDC.

This recommendation must be adopted by the FDA, which is expected in the coming days.    Pfizer will pre-position the first shipment of 4,875 doses of vaccine in Hawai‘i, but providers will not be able to begin to vaccinate groups in the first phase until the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides guidance on who can be vaccinated. ACIP guidance is also expected in the coming days.    “This pandemic has cost Hawai‘i residents so much—the lives of loved ones, our health, and our economic security,” said Governor David Ige. “The recommendation by the FDA panel to approve the Pfizer vaccine is a vital step in keeping our situation from becoming worse and beginning our road to recovery. Once final approval is granted, I am confident in DOH’s ability to distribute vaccines across Hawai‘i.”    Dr. Char commented, “However, we know that our work is just beginning. After months of planning, we are prepared to join with our partners to distribute the first shipments of a vaccine. As there will not be enough vaccine for everyone at first, we must first care for those who cared for us—essential healthcare workers and kupuna in long-term care facilities.”    The first phase of Hawai‘i’s COVID-19 Vaccination Plan is divided into three groups:        Phase 1a – Essential healthcare workers      Phase 1b – Essential workers      Phase 1c – 65 years and older and adults with high-risk medical conditions    The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled to be evaluated by the FDA committee on Dec. 17. If approval is granted, Hawai‘i is expected to receive 36,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine, in addition to nearly 46,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in December alone.    Essential health care workers will be vaccinated at Points of Dispensing (PODs) across the state.

This includes plans to distribute an expected 81,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccinations in December to high-risk health care workers and long-term care facilities across the state.    Earlier today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee recommended Emergency Use Authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This recommendation must be adopted by the FDA, which is expected in the coming days.    Pfizer will pre-position the first shipment of 4,875 doses of vaccine in Hawai‘i, but providers will not be able to begin to vaccinate groups in the first phase until the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides guidance on who can be vaccinated. ACIP guidance is also expected in the coming days.    “This pandemic has cost Hawai‘i residents so much—the lives of loved ones, our health, and our economic security,” said Governor David Ige. “The recommendation by the FDA panel to approve the Pfizer vaccine is a vital step in keeping our situation from becoming worse and beginning our road to recovery. Once final approval is granted, I am confident in DOH’s ability to distribute vaccines across Hawai‘i.”    Dr. Char commented, “However, we know that our work is just beginning. After months of planning, we are prepared to join with our partners to distribute the first shipments of a vaccine. As there will not be enough vaccine for everyone at first, we must first care for those who cared for us—essential healthcare workers and kupuna in long-term care facilities.”    The first phase of Hawai‘i’s COVID-19 Vaccination Plan is divided into three groups:        Phase 1a – Essential healthcare workers      Phase 1b – Essential workers      Phase 1c – 65 years and older and adults with high-risk medical conditions    The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled to be evaluated by the FDA committee on Dec. 17. If approval is granted, Hawai‘i is expected to receive 36,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine, in addition to nearly 46,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in December alone.    Essential health care workers will be vaccinated at Points of Dispensing (PODs) across the state.
