The order also includes additional guidance around the wearing of face coverings in restaurants and gyms.     In restaurants, Delawareans and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings when waitstaff visits a table, and whenever they are not eating or drinking. Customers must wear coverings if they leave their table and while entering or exiting the establishment.     In gyms and other exercise facilities, Delawareans must wear face coverings when they are not engaged in vigorous physical activity. Vigorous physical activity – or high-intensity exercise – is defined as a physical activity done with a large amount of effort, resulting in a substantially higher heart rate and rapid breathing. Delawareans must wear face coverings while weight-lifting, which is not considered vigorous physical activity, and everyone is strongly encouraged to wear face coverings at all times in gyms.     According to the updated order, bars in Delaware beach communities may reopen on Friday (4th Sep) for food service with significant safety precautions. Reservations are required for bar service, and food must be ordered. Patrons must maintain six (6) feet social distance from non-household members.

"904","Nebraska","US_NE","01-Oct","H1_Public.information.campaigns",1,"G",1,"G","On October 1, the Nebraska of Health and Human Services published the ollowing 7 tips are adapted from The American Psychological Association (“Check Out the Stress Tip Sheet,” 2018) to support individuals with a stress management plan:  Understand your stress: How do you stress? It can be different for everybody. By understanding what stress looks like for you, you can be better prepared, and reach for your stress management toolbox when needed.  Identify your stress sources: What causes you to be stressed? Be it work, family, change or any of the other potential thousand triggers.  Learn to recognize stress signals: We all process stress differently so it’s important to be aware of your individual stress symptoms. What are your internal alarm bells? Low tolerance, headaches, stomach pains or a combination?  Recognize your stress strategies: What is your go-to tactic for calming down? These can be behaviors learned over years and sometimes aren’t the healthy option. For example, some people cope with stress by self-medicating with alcohol or overeating.  Implement healthy stress management strategies: It’s good to be mindful of any current unhealthy coping behaviors so you can switch them out for a healthy option. For example, if overeating is your current go to, you could practice meditation instead, or make a decision to phone a friend to chat through your situation. The American Psychological Association suggest that switching out one behavior at a time is most effective in creating positive change.  Make self-care a priority: When we make time for ourselves, we put our well-being before others. This can feel selfish to start, but it is like the airplane analogy—we must put our own oxygen mask on before we can assist others. The simplest things that promote well-being, such as enough sleep, food, downtime, and exercise are often the ones overlooked.Self-care is group-care.   Ask for support when needed: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, reach out to a friend or family member you can talk to. Speaking with a healthcare professional can also reduce stress, and help us learn healthier coping strategies.

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has broadened its Standing Order (linked below) to include all individuals who think they need a COVID-19 test. This means that participating sites may test anyone in Maine over the age of 12 months who feels they need a test, even if they don't have a primary care provider or a written order from a clinician.   As Maine’s previous testing policy had to do with referrals from healthcare providers rather than whether the person getting tested had symptoms or not, the coding of 3 will not be retroactively changed. This indicator will also remain at 3, given the expanded Standing Order.
