"72","ARE","United Arab Emirates","21-Mar-21","4G","4G","ABU DHABI, 20th March, 2021 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Health and Prevention has urged all Emiratis and residents eligible for COVID-19 vaccination to start booking appointments for inoculation starting Sunday, March 21, now that the six-week priority entitlement given to people who are most at risk of infection is over.    Those eligible for vaccination, including citizens and residents aged 16 and above, can now get inoculated for free in any of the 205 vaccination locations available nationwide, the ministry said in a statement tonight.    The statement said it's incumbent on those opting for vaccination to get prior booking as those who are most vulnerable to infection will continue to be received by vaccination centres without prior booking.    The past six weeks saw a collaborative effort made by all health departments to prioritise those most at risk of infection, including the elderly and people with chronic diseases, such as heart, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses.    In the meantime, Dr. Abdul Rahman bin Mohammad bin Nasser Al Owais, Minister of Health and Prevention, said Saturday that 72.89 percent of elderly Emiratis and residents and those with chronic diseases have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and that 56.59 percent of the eligible population have been inoculated against the disease.    In line with the Ministry's plans as well as the objectives of the National COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, to ensure acquired community immunity, the Ministry has urged all the eligible population to get vaccinated and to encourage their family members, friends and colleagues to follow suit for their common good.    The UAE has approved four Covid vaccines for emergency uses: Sinopharm; Pfizer-BioNTech; Sputnik V; and Oxford-AstraZeneca. In addition, MoHAP is constantly working to get the entire UAE population vaccinated as soon as possible.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210322152304/http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302920029"

"133","BEL","Belgium","28-Dec-20","0","1G","C:    On 21 December 2020, the EMA issued a positive opinion on the biontech/Pfizer vaccine and it was subsequently approved by the European Commission. On 28 December, this vaccine was administered for the first time in 3 Belgian residential care centres (located in Puurs, Brussels and Mons). From 5 January, this vaccination will be rolled out in all residential care centres. Currently, vaccines from two other companies, Moderna and Astra Zeneca/Oxford, are also undergoing the strict control of the EMA. The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed on 6 January 2021. If successful, the European Commission can give its final approval and green light for the use of this vaccine. Other potential vaccines will be examined later, including those from Johnson & Johnson or Curevac.      Will the vaccine be available to everyone from the start?  No. The vaccines will be produced continuously and quantity available will increase as they are delivered. Pending their large-scale production, several steps should be planned to best protect the most vulnerable groups and gradually increase individual immunity. (see question “Who are the priority groups?"")  At the moment, it is difficult to provide a precise schedule for the administration of these vaccines. Therefore, monitoring the progressive availability of the vaccine per priority group is crucial.    To increase the population’s immunity and to protect those most vulnerable from the virus, vaccination will take place in three phases, depending on the number of doses available.    GROUP 1a    First, the most vulnerable and exposed people will be vaccinated.    Residents and employees of residential care centres and collective care institutions: since the outbreak of the pandemic, COVID-19 has hit elderly people hard, especially those living in residential care centres. They will be vaccinated first, followed by the staff (including volunteers), followed by collective care institutions.  The medical staff from primary care and hospitals: they are in close contact with patients with Covid-19 on a daily basis. To protect them, they are vaccinated as a matter of priority.  Next, the other staff in hospitals and health services will be vaccinated, including organisations responsible for prevention activities, such as vaccination and cancer screening centres, ONE and Kind en Gezin.  In this first phase, this will require a special organisation and infrastructure (extremely low storage temperatures, multiple doses, etc.).    GROUP 1b : vulnerable people without acute medical problems but at high risk    In this phase it is expected that vaccines will become more widely available. It will then be possible to vaccinate larger groups of people. Priority will be given to people outside the hospital who are most at risk. These are the following groups:    People over 65: people over 65 are the first priority at this stage. If sufficient vaccine is available, all these people can be vaccinated at the same time. Otherwise we start with the oldest people and then work our way down.  People between 45-65 years of age with an increased risk: Then people between 45-65 years come with risk factors, such as:  Diabetes,  Hypertension, Chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver disorders, haematological cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis,  All recent cancers (or recent cancer treatments)  Obesity (Body Mass Index = 30).  This list will be updated and expanded in the light of scientific developments,    Essential professions: In this phase, people with essential social and/or economic professions are vaccinated. In this second phase, we can expect fewer logistical bottlenecks and organising the vaccination will be easier for these target groups.  GROUP 2 - general population    Thirdly, vaccine doses will be available in sufficient quantities to vaccinate the rest of the population.    At this stage it can be expected that the doses can be stored and administered like other vaccines such as the flu vaccine).    https://web.archive.org/web/20210115165454/https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/vaccination/    Note: Belgium was criticised for being slow off the mark with vaccinations:  About 700 residents and staff of care homes have gotten their first shot as of January 2, when the government provided its latest update on the tally. In Germany, by contrast, roughly 317,000 doses have been administered, and about 182,000 in Italy. Yves Van Laethem, an infectious diseases specialist and spokesman for Belgium's COVID-19 crisis center, said the country is also getting fewer doses than initially promised by Pfizer — only 320,000 instead of 600,000 by late December — forcing the government to make a choice between healthcare workers and the elderly. They said they would prioritise the elderly. Hence only one group have been vaccinated in this early stage.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210107121941/https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-government-criticism-coronavirus-vaccine-campaign-frank-vandenbroucke/    Other notes:  Belgium received its first batch of 9,750 vaccines last Saturday (Dec 26, 2020) and began vaccinating  between 300 and 400 people today.     Residents and staff of care homes and health care professionals will be the first to be vaccinated. Vaccinations started in three care homes across Belgium (Woluwe-Saint-Pierre in Brussels, Mons in Wallonia and Puurs in Flanders, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was produced).    Under the second phase of the plan, people over 65, patients between 45 and 65 years old at high risk from the virus due to obesity or lung disease, and people with essential jobs will get their shot. Finally, other at-risk patients and the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated.    The timing of the different phases will depend on how many doses are available at different times, and how difficult it is to store the vaccines.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165332/https://www.euronews.com/2020/12/28/covid-vaccine-man-96-is-first-to-receive-coronavirus-jab-in-belgium  https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165542/https://www.politico.eu/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-belgiums-vaccination-strategy/"

Professor Corinne Vandermeulen, a professor at the KU Leuven Vaccinology Department says, ""we're doing the best we can. And of course there can be critics and I know that people criticize the fact that we choose to vaccinate the people in the long term care facilities first and that we might have started with healthcare workers maybe first instead of the elderly.

"153","BEN","Benin","08-Mar-21","0","0","One year after the start of the pandemic in Benin, the COVAX initiative shipped 144,000 doses of the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine, licensed by the Serum Institute in India, to Cotonou on March 10, 2021.    This delivery is the first batch received by Benin thanks to the COVAX facility which aims to support the Government's efforts and ensure fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination. In total, 792,000 doses of vaccines will be delivered to Benin through the COVAX initiative by May 2021.    The 144,000 initial doses of vaccines were received at Cardinal Bernadin Gantin International Airport by Minister of Health Benjamin Hounkpatin and members of the COVAX initiative, namely the UNICEF Representative and the WHO Representative, accompanied by the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Benin.    Benin thus joins the list of African countries that have received their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine via the COVAX mechanism. This arrival constitutes a major step forward for Benin in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and a historic moment towards the objective of ensuring an equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines throughout the world, within the framework of what constitutes the largest vaccine purchase and supply operation in history.    “Benin is very happy to receive its first vaccines against COVID-19 through the COVAX initiative. Receipt of vaccines marks a turning point in the national response to the pandemic. We are confident that with these vaccines our efforts to protect the population against the virus will be strengthened. However, we must increase awareness so that communities continue to respect barrier gestures, even after the introduction of the vaccine, ”said Minister of Health Benjamin Hounkpatin.    “These vaccines from the COVAX initiative are the result of multilateralism and international cooperation aimed at making the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good. An important step remains to be taken, that of mobilizing the population for vaccination. I would therefore like to reiterate the commitment of the United Nations to support the Government to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible, so that no one is left behind, ”said the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Benin Salvator Niyonzima .    “Vaccination saves lives every year by protecting children from serious illness. With the arrival of vaccines against COVID-19, it is a ray of hope that looms on the horizon because, among the targets to be vaccinated as a priority are those that ensure the right to health and protection for each child. Our thanks also go to all our donor partners who support us on a daily basis in this initiative, ”said UNICEF Representative Djanabou Mahondé.    According to Dr Mamoudou Harouna Djingarey, Acting Resident Representative of WHO, “WHO is delighted with the successful outcome of the negotiations and agreements that have taken place between the various United Nations agencies and international and national partners to provide States with that of Benin, the quantity of vaccines needed to save human lives against COVID-19. This is a historic step in solidarity and the race towards equitable access to anti-COVID-19 vaccines for low-income countries as advocated by the COVAX initiative which is to ensure an equitable distribution of global COVID-19 vaccines ”.    “This is the most ambitious pandemic response initiative in history, and we see an important milestone in our joint efforts now that Benin and other countries in Africa begin to roll out vaccines for their most vulnerable populations, ”said Dr Antoinette Eya Awaga, Country Manager of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. ""To ensure that the pandemic is behind us, we must maintain a sense of urgency and a spirit of partnership so that countries' immunization campaigns are successful, health systems recover and livelihoods be restored ”.    The vaccines transported to Benin with the support of UNICEF come from India. This first batch of vaccines will be administered to 70,000 front-line health workers and the most vulnerable, such as people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities. In total, 20% of the population is expected to benefit from COVAX vaccines.    A shipment of 145,000 syringes and 1,450 safety boxes, from a Gavi-funded stock from UNICEF's regional supply center in Dubai, was received on March 7, 2021.

It has become apparent that these priorities are being put into practice differently from canton to canton. In particular there are differences in the vaccination of healthcare professionals. For this reason the Federal Vaccination Commission (EKIF/CFV) and the FOPH have drawn up guidelines specifying which groups of healthcare professionals may possibly be vaccinated at the same time as especially vulnerable people (target group 1). Given that volumes of vaccine are currently limited, the goal is to assure the provision of healthcare in areas that are particularly affected while making sufficient vaccine available for especially vulnerable people at the highest risk.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210205081724/https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/impfen.html"

"393","CHN","China","06-Dec-20",NA,"0","12 December    Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people.    Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a U.N. meeting last week    https://web.archive.org/web/20201207184213/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/06/china-prepares-large-scale-rollout-of-coronavirus-vaccines-443159"
"394","CHN","China","14-Dec-20","0","0","This extended note aims to capture the progress on vaccination programme before it is rolled out to the entire country (does not include R&D, clinic trials).    The China National Medicine Products Administration (MPA) has not formally approved the Sinopharm Inactivated vaccine to go to the market. However, the green light is anticipated in the next few days.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214212000/https://weareunited.com.my/11515744/    On 24 June 2020, the MPA approved the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine. Voluntary vaccination started on around 17 June. The first batch of receivers consisted mainly of key workers, including state-owned enterprise employees who must go overseas to countries where the pandemic hits hard; medical staff, epidemic-control staff, border force and other essential workers who keep cities running.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231804/https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/cyxw/2020-11-18/doc-iiznezxs2537217.shtml    From mid-October, Zhejiang province has offered vaccines to ordinary citizens on a voluntary basis. The rationale has been that many cities in Zhejiang have export-oriented economies; for example, Yiwu city is the world centre for light industry commodity trading. Many wholesale merchants were keen on receiving vaccines so that they can travel to Latin America and Africa to inspect their businesses. See BBC reports below. By mid-November, Zhejiang had provided vaccines to some 743,000 people. Voluntary vaccines were paid by recipients. Two doses cost roughly 400 CNY plus a service charge of around 56 CNY, which altogether equals to approximately 70 USD.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231741/https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-54628714    As the vaccination programme is yet to roll out to the whole country, there is no national policy on who will get the vaccine first. However, Sichuan province, where the most recent cluster of infection was found, did publish a detailed plan to that sets out the order:    The first group to receive vaccines consists of people facing high risks of infection, including medical staffs with International assistance mission, national health emergency rescue team in Sichuan, fever clinic and frontline doctors and nurses, border control force, frontline health inspection and epidemic-control officials, students or workers going overseas, police force, frozen food industry workers, essential workers for keeping cities running, teachers, other medical staffs, doctors and nurses, community social workers. The first batch is estimated to have 2 million people. Vaccination for them has started and will finish within 2020.    The second group to receive vaccines mainly consists of vulnerable people, including elderly people and people with chronic diseases. Vaccination for them will start from early next year (January).    The third batch will open to the general public. Ordinary people are estimated to start receiving vaccines after the Chinese New Year (12 February 2021).    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214221555/https://www.sohu.com/a/437018675_114988    So far, vaccination is not and is unlike to be paid by social medical insurance funds in the future. The National Health Security Administration has cited laws and regulations as the justification that vaccination is a part of public health effort, which should be shouldered by public finance resources, rather than social medical insurance funds.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214211226/https://www.sohu.com/a/425495553_114986    UAE and Bahrain have formally approved the Sinopharm vaccine on 9th and 13th December 2020 respectively.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231619/http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-12/09/c_1126842251.htm  http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231549/http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-12/14/c_1126855787.htm"

This signal shows the strong will of the president. Today is a sampling, and this sampling will be duplicated,” he said. “The president wants all Guineans to be in good health in relation to this pandemic.”    Amadou Damaro Camara, the president of the country’s legislative body, the National Assembly, was also vaccinated.    “We are the guinea pigs,” he said of receiving the first doses of the vaccine.    “It is the government’s permanent concern to want to fight against this disease and we are very happy about it,” he said. “We hope that this vaccination will be extended to the rest of the people and that it will be the beginning of the eradication of this disease.”  Tibou Camara, Guinea’s industry minister, also spoke on the television broadcast after being vaccinated.    “The Guinean population should be congratulated and rejoice at a time when the vaccine is coveted and not very accessible to many countries, and that our country is a beneficiary,” he said.    Russia has businesses in the West African nation and Guinea is known for its bauxite mining.

The response gives hope to the  COVID-19 fight in our country. On the overall, the rolling out has been smooth although in  some vaccination sites, we observed long queues due to high numbers of people coming to get vaccinated against the available staff. There were also some information gaps in some communities especially in the rural areas. In view of this, the Government through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has allocated additional resources to assist in vaccination roll out. These resources will help to address the bottlenecks currently being observed. As we are working on these challenges, I would like to appeal for patience as we will ensure that everyone targeted in the first receives the vaccine.    Once again I would like to thank those that have made the excellent decision to get vaccinated. This is very commendable since fighting the COVID-19 pandemic is a collective effort. Let me also request those that are not eligible to receive the vaccine in the first phase, to patiently wait for their turn which will be communicated in due course. My request for those not eligible is to desist from going to the vaccination sites now to give opportunity to the elderly and those with co-morbidities to be vaccinated since COVID-19 tends to be more severe in these categories of people.

Initially, vaccines will be prioritized for three key population groups: older people, people with certain chronic conditions and key healthcare workers.    Older people   Evidence from both here in Qatar and around the world clearly shows that the risk of developing severe complications due to COVID-19 increases with age. People over 60 years of age have a higher risk of severe illness and death.     People with severe chronic conditions   People with certain long-term chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, or compromised immune systems, have an increased risk of developing severe complications as a result of COVID-19, regardless of their age.     Healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to COVID-19?    Healthcare workers, especially doctors, nurses and paramedics working directly with COVID-19 patients, have an increased risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and catching the virus and becoming sick. Additionally, healthcare workers who catch the virus can spread it to their patients, many of whom may be at increased risk of severe complications due to chronic conditions or compromised immune systems. ??  /web/20210209193238/https://covid19.moph.gov.qa/EN/Covid19-Vaccine/Pages/Priority-groups.aspx"

As of 18 February 2021, about 250,000 individuals have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Amongst them, more than 110,000 have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen. Following the successful pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, we will commence COVID-19 vaccinations for seniors in the community from 22 February.    3.    COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from 22 February. Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. By mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town, all seniors will be able to receive their vaccination. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March.    4.    Thereafter we will move to vaccinate the seniors aged 60 to 69 years. They will receive their invitation letters around the middle of March, and the vaccination will commence from around end-March onwards.    8.   To ensure that seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations, we will set up more vaccination centres in the coming weeks. Currently, there are 11 vaccination centres in operation[3]. Three more vaccination centres located at community centres/clubs will commence operations by 22 February, at Bukit Timah, Marine Parade and Taman Jurong, bringing the total to 14. By the middle of March, 31 vaccination centres will be in operation, with at least one vaccination centre in each town. In total, there will eventually be around 40 vaccination centres, with each vaccination centre planned for an estimated capacity of 2,000 vaccinations per day.    http://archive.today/2021.02.22-144640/https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/start-of-covid-19-vaccination-for-seniors    Coding note: the code for H7 was previously changed from 1G to 2G on 27th January in response to the pilot vaccination programme for elderly groups at Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar."
