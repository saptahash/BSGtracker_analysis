"65","CHN","China","14-Dec-20","0","0","This extended note aims to capture the progress on vaccination programme before it is rolled out to the entire country (does not include R&D, clinic trials).    The China National Medicine Products Administration (MPA) has not formally approved the Sinopharm Inactivated vaccine to go to the market. However, the green light is anticipated in the next few days.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214212000/https://weareunited.com.my/11515744/    On 24 June 2020, the MPA approved the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine. Voluntary vaccination started on around 17 June. The first batch of receivers consisted mainly of key workers, including state-owned enterprise employees who must go overseas to countries where the pandemic hits hard; medical staff, epidemic-control staff, border force and other essential workers who keep cities running.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231804/https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/cyxw/2020-11-18/doc-iiznezxs2537217.shtml    From mid-October, Zhejiang province has offered vaccines to ordinary citizens on a voluntary basis. The rationale has been that many cities in Zhejiang have export-oriented economies; for example, Yiwu city is the world centre for light industry commodity trading. Many wholesale merchants were keen on receiving vaccines so that they can travel to Latin America and Africa to inspect their businesses. See BBC reports below. By mid-November, Zhejiang had provided vaccines to some 743,000 people. Voluntary vaccines were paid by recipients. Two doses cost roughly 400 CNY plus a service charge of around 56 CNY, which altogether equals to approximately 70 USD.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231741/https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-54628714    As the vaccination programme is yet to roll out to the whole country, there is no national policy on who will get the vaccine first. However, Sichuan province, where the most recent cluster of infection was found, did publish a detailed plan to that sets out the order:    The first group to receive vaccines consists of people facing high risks of infection, including medical staffs with International assistance mission, national health emergency rescue team in Sichuan, fever clinic and frontline doctors and nurses, border control force, frontline health inspection and epidemic-control officials, students or workers going overseas, police force, frozen food industry workers, essential workers for keeping cities running, teachers, other medical staffs, doctors and nurses, community social workers. The first batch is estimated to have 2 million people. Vaccination for them has started and will finish within 2020.    The second group to receive vaccines mainly consists of vulnerable people, including elderly people and people with chronic diseases. Vaccination for them will start from early next year (January).    The third batch will open to the general public. Ordinary people are estimated to start receiving vaccines after the Chinese New Year (12 February 2021).    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214221555/https://www.sohu.com/a/437018675_114988    So far, vaccination is not and is unlike to be paid by social medical insurance funds in the future. The National Health Security Administration has cited laws and regulations as the justification that vaccination is a part of public health effort, which should be shouldered by public finance resources, rather than social medical insurance funds.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214211226/https://www.sohu.com/a/425495553_114986    UAE and Bahrain have formally approved the Sinopharm vaccine on 9th and 13th December 2020 respectively.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231619/http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-12/09/c_1126842251.htm  http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231549/http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-12/14/c_1126855787.htm"
