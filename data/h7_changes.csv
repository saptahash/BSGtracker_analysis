"109","ARE","United Arab Emirates","21-Mar-21","4G","4G","ABU DHABI, 20th March, 2021 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Health and Prevention has urged all Emiratis and residents eligible for COVID-19 vaccination to start booking appointments for inoculation starting Sunday, March 21, now that the six-week priority entitlement given to people who are most at risk of infection is over.    Those eligible for vaccination, including citizens and residents aged 16 and above, can now get inoculated for free in any of the 205 vaccination locations available nationwide, the ministry said in a statement tonight.    The statement said it's incumbent on those opting for vaccination to get prior booking as those who are most vulnerable to infection will continue to be received by vaccination centres without prior booking.    The past six weeks saw a collaborative effort made by all health departments to prioritise those most at risk of infection, including the elderly and people with chronic diseases, such as heart, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses.    In the meantime, Dr. Abdul Rahman bin Mohammad bin Nasser Al Owais, Minister of Health and Prevention, said Saturday that 72.89 percent of elderly Emiratis and residents and those with chronic diseases have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and that 56.59 percent of the eligible population have been inoculated against the disease.    In line with the Ministry's plans as well as the objectives of the National COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, to ensure acquired community immunity, the Ministry has urged all the eligible population to get vaccinated and to encourage their family members, friends and colleagues to follow suit for their common good.    The UAE has approved four Covid vaccines for emergency uses: Sinopharm; Pfizer-BioNTech; Sputnik V; and Oxford-AstraZeneca. In addition, MoHAP is constantly working to get the entire UAE population vaccinated as soon as possible.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210322152304/http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302920029"

"231","BEL","Belgium","28-Dec-20","0","1G","C:    On 21 December 2020, the EMA issued a positive opinion on the biontech/Pfizer vaccine and it was subsequently approved by the European Commission. On 28 December, this vaccine was administered for the first time in 3 Belgian residential care centres (located in Puurs, Brussels and Mons). From 5 January, this vaccination will be rolled out in all residential care centres. Currently, vaccines from two other companies, Moderna and Astra Zeneca/Oxford, are also undergoing the strict control of the EMA. The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed on 6 January 2021. If successful, the European Commission can give its final approval and green light for the use of this vaccine. Other potential vaccines will be examined later, including those from Johnson & Johnson or Curevac.      Will the vaccine be available to everyone from the start?  No. The vaccines will be produced continuously and quantity available will increase as they are delivered. Pending their large-scale production, several steps should be planned to best protect the most vulnerable groups and gradually increase individual immunity. (see question “Who are the priority groups?"")  At the moment, it is difficult to provide a precise schedule for the administration of these vaccines. Therefore, monitoring the progressive availability of the vaccine per priority group is crucial.    To increase the population’s immunity and to protect those most vulnerable from the virus, vaccination will take place in three phases, depending on the number of doses available.    GROUP 1a    First, the most vulnerable and exposed people will be vaccinated.    Residents and employees of residential care centres and collective care institutions: since the outbreak of the pandemic, COVID-19 has hit elderly people hard, especially those living in residential care centres. They will be vaccinated first, followed by the staff (including volunteers), followed by collective care institutions.  The medical staff from primary care and hospitals: they are in close contact with patients with Covid-19 on a daily basis. To protect them, they are vaccinated as a matter of priority.  Next, the other staff in hospitals and health services will be vaccinated, including organisations responsible for prevention activities, such as vaccination and cancer screening centres, ONE and Kind en Gezin.  In this first phase, this will require a special organisation and infrastructure (extremely low storage temperatures, multiple doses, etc.).    GROUP 1b : vulnerable people without acute medical problems but at high risk    In this phase it is expected that vaccines will become more widely available. It will then be possible to vaccinate larger groups of people. Priority will be given to people outside the hospital who are most at risk. These are the following groups:    People over 65: people over 65 are the first priority at this stage. If sufficient vaccine is available, all these people can be vaccinated at the same time. Otherwise we start with the oldest people and then work our way down.  People between 45-65 years of age with an increased risk: Then people between 45-65 years come with risk factors, such as:  Diabetes,  Hypertension, Chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver disorders, haematological cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis,  All recent cancers (or recent cancer treatments)  Obesity (Body Mass Index = 30).  This list will be updated and expanded in the light of scientific developments,    Essential professions: In this phase, people with essential social and/or economic professions are vaccinated. In this second phase, we can expect fewer logistical bottlenecks and organising the vaccination will be easier for these target groups.  GROUP 2 - general population    Thirdly, vaccine doses will be available in sufficient quantities to vaccinate the rest of the population.    At this stage it can be expected that the doses can be stored and administered like other vaccines such as the flu vaccine).    https://web.archive.org/web/20210115165454/https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/vaccination/    Note: Belgium was criticised for being slow off the mark with vaccinations:  About 700 residents and staff of care homes have gotten their first shot as of January 2, when the government provided its latest update on the tally. In Germany, by contrast, roughly 317,000 doses have been administered, and about 182,000 in Italy. Yves Van Laethem, an infectious diseases specialist and spokesman for Belgium's COVID-19 crisis center, said the country is also getting fewer doses than initially promised by Pfizer — only 320,000 instead of 600,000 by late December — forcing the government to make a choice between healthcare workers and the elderly. They said they would prioritise the elderly. Hence only one group have been vaccinated in this early stage.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210107121941/https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-government-criticism-coronavirus-vaccine-campaign-frank-vandenbroucke/    Other notes:  Belgium received its first batch of 9,750 vaccines last Saturday (Dec 26, 2020) and began vaccinating  between 300 and 400 people today.     Residents and staff of care homes and health care professionals will be the first to be vaccinated. Vaccinations started in three care homes across Belgium (Woluwe-Saint-Pierre in Brussels, Mons in Wallonia and Puurs in Flanders, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was produced).    Under the second phase of the plan, people over 65, patients between 45 and 65 years old at high risk from the virus due to obesity or lung disease, and people with essential jobs will get their shot. Finally, other at-risk patients and the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated.    The timing of the different phases will depend on how many doses are available at different times, and how difficult it is to store the vaccines.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165332/https://www.euronews.com/2020/12/28/covid-vaccine-man-96-is-first-to-receive-coronavirus-jab-in-belgium  https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165542/https://www.politico.eu/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-belgiums-vaccination-strategy/"

Only 700 doses were used, out of the 10,000+ vaccine doses delivered on December 28, 2020.     Professor Corinne Vandermeulen, a professor at the KU Leuven Vaccinology Department says, ""we're doing the best we can. And of course there can be critics and I know that people criticize the fact that we choose to vaccinate the people in the long term care facilities first and that we might have started with healthcare workers maybe first instead of the elderly. But the elderly, they are the most vulnerable.""    By the start of this week, only 700 of the over 10 thousand vaccine doses delivered to Belgium by an EU scheme on December 28th had been put into people's arms.

This delivery is the first batch received by Benin thanks to the COVAX facility which aims to support the Government's efforts and ensure fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination. In total, 792,000 doses of vaccines will be delivered to Benin through the COVAX initiative by May 2021.    The 144,000 initial doses of vaccines were received at Cardinal Bernadin Gantin International Airport by Minister of Health Benjamin Hounkpatin and members of the COVAX initiative, namely the UNICEF Representative and the WHO Representative, accompanied by the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Benin.    Benin thus joins the list of African countries that have received their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine via the COVAX mechanism. This arrival constitutes a major step forward for Benin in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and a historic moment towards the objective of ensuring an equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines throughout the world, within the framework of what constitutes the largest vaccine purchase and supply operation in history.    “Benin is very happy to receive its first vaccines against COVID-19 through the COVAX initiative. Receipt of vaccines marks a turning point in the national response to the pandemic. We are confident that with these vaccines our efforts to protect the population against the virus will be strengthened. However, we must increase awareness so that communities continue to respect barrier gestures, even after the introduction of the vaccine, ”said Minister of Health Benjamin Hounkpatin.    “These vaccines from the COVAX initiative are the result of multilateralism and international cooperation aimed at making the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good. An important step remains to be taken, that of mobilizing the population for vaccination. I would therefore like to reiterate the commitment of the United Nations to support the Government to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible, so that no one is left behind, ”said the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Benin Salvator Niyonzima .    “Vaccination saves lives every year by protecting children from serious illness. With the arrival of vaccines against COVID-19, it is a ray of hope that looms on the horizon because, among the targets to be vaccinated as a priority are those that ensure the right to health and protection for each child. Our thanks also go to all our donor partners who support us on a daily basis in this initiative, ”said UNICEF Representative Djanabou Mahondé.    According to Dr Mamoudou Harouna Djingarey, Acting Resident Representative of WHO, “WHO is delighted with the successful outcome of the negotiations and agreements that have taken place between the various United Nations agencies and international and national partners to provide States with that of Benin, the quantity of vaccines needed to save human lives against COVID-19. This is a historic step in solidarity and the race towards equitable access to anti-COVID-19 vaccines for low-income countries as advocated by the COVAX initiative which is to ensure an equitable distribution of global COVID-19 vaccines ”.    “This is the most ambitious pandemic response initiative in history, and we see an important milestone in our joint efforts now that Benin and other countries in Africa begin to roll out vaccines for their most vulnerable populations, ”said Dr Antoinette Eya Awaga, Country Manager of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. ""To ensure that the pandemic is behind us, we must maintain a sense of urgency and a spirit of partnership so that countries' immunization campaigns are successful, health systems recover and livelihoods be restored ”.    The vaccines transported to Benin with the support of UNICEF come from India. This first batch of vaccines will be administered to 70,000 front-line health workers and the most vulnerable, such as people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities. In total, 20% of the population is expected to benefit from COVAX vaccines.    A shipment of 145,000 syringes and 1,450 safety boxes, from a Gavi-funded stock from UNICEF's regional supply center in Dubai, was received on March 7, 2021.

Since the implementation of the National Vaccination Program for COVID-19 began on 3 April 2021, a total of 14,876 people have received the COVID-19 vaccine, of which 14,526 people have received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 350 people have received the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.    At present, the administration of COVID-19 vaccine is still being implemented for Phase One, consisting of frontliners, students studying abroad and senior citizens aged 60 and above. Priority is given to frontliners and especially the elderly because frontliners have a higher risk of being infected with COVID-19 and the elderly have a higher risk of getting more severe complications of COVID-19 infection. Without COVID-19 vaccine injections, clinical data obtained from around the world show those aged 60 and above are more likely to get the effects of more severe infections that require treatment in the Intensive Care Unit including respiratory assistance and have a higher risk of death as a result of the COVID-19 infection. Scientific studies have also shown that injection of COVID-19 vaccine can reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for the elderly and frontliners.""    Separate to the press release by the Ministry of Health, the Minister of Health also stated that “Brunei Darussalam will receive 200,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine and 300,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in addition to more than 100,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in several batches. This will help to cover the COVID-19 vaccination for 70 per cent of the population by end of this year,” confirming the future expansion of Brunei's vaccination programme to use the Pfizer-BioNTech (tozinameran) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines, and the use of these two vaccines will account for 55% of Brunei's population.

It has become apparent that these priorities are being put into practice differently from canton to canton. In particular there are differences in the vaccination of healthcare professionals. For this reason the Federal Vaccination Commission (EKIF/CFV) and the FOPH have drawn up guidelines specifying which groups of healthcare professionals may possibly be vaccinated at the same time as especially vulnerable people (target group 1). Given that volumes of vaccine are currently limited, the goal is to assure the provision of healthcare in areas that are particularly affected while making sufficient vaccine available for especially vulnerable people at the highest risk.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210205081724/https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/impfen.html"

The China National Medicine Products Administration (MPA) has not formally approved the Sinopharm Inactivated vaccine to go to the market. However, the green light is anticipated in the next few days.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214212000/https://weareunited.com.my/11515744/    On 24 June 2020, the MPA approved the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine. Voluntary vaccination started on around 17 June. The first batch of receivers consisted mainly of key workers, including state-owned enterprise employees who must go overseas to countries where the pandemic hits hard; medical staff, epidemic-control staff, border force and other essential workers who keep cities running.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231804/https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/cyxw/2020-11-18/doc-iiznezxs2537217.shtml    From mid-October, Zhejiang province has offered vaccines to ordinary citizens on a voluntary basis. The rationale has been that many cities in Zhejiang have export-oriented economies; for example, Yiwu city is the world centre for light industry commodity trading. Many wholesale merchants were keen on receiving vaccines so that they can travel to Latin America and Africa to inspect their businesses. See BBC reports below. By mid-November, Zhejiang had provided vaccines to some 743,000 people. Voluntary vaccines were paid by recipients. Two doses cost roughly 400 CNY plus a service charge of around 56 CNY, which altogether equals to approximately 70 USD.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231741/https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-54628714    As the vaccination programme is yet to roll out to the whole country, there is no national policy on who will get the vaccine first. However, Sichuan province, where the most recent cluster of infection was found, did publish a detailed plan to that sets out the order:    The first group to receive vaccines consists of people facing high risks of infection, including medical staffs with International assistance mission, national health emergency rescue team in Sichuan, fever clinic and frontline doctors and nurses, border control force, frontline health inspection and epidemic-control officials, students or workers going overseas, police force, frozen food industry workers, essential workers for keeping cities running, teachers, other medical staffs, doctors and nurses, community social workers. The first batch is estimated to have 2 million people. Vaccination for them has started and will finish within 2020.    The second group to receive vaccines mainly consists of vulnerable people, including elderly people and people with chronic diseases. Vaccination for them will start from early next year (January).    The third batch will open to the general public. Ordinary people are estimated to start receiving vaccines after the Chinese New Year (12 February 2021).    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214221555/https://www.sohu.com/a/437018675_114988    So far, vaccination is not and is unlike to be paid by social medical insurance funds in the future. The National Health Security Administration has cited laws and regulations as the justification that vaccination is a part of public health effort, which should be shouldered by public finance resources, rather than social medical insurance funds.     http://web.archive.org/web/20201214211226/https://www.sohu.com/a/425495553_114986    UAE and Bahrain have formally approved the Sinopharm vaccine on 9th and 13th December 2020 respectively.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231619/http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-12/09/c_1126842251.htm  http://web.archive.org/web/20201214231549/http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2020-12/14/c_1126855787.htm"

This is the beginning of an order,” Keita said. “Yesterday we vaccinated in this pilot phase 25 senior officials of the state. There are 30 doses left and we will continue with the vaccination.”    However, he said on state TV Wednesday that they also sent a letter to Russia requesting 2 million doses of Sputnik V to help the country’s vulnerable. Guinea has a population of 13 million.    Guinea is one of the first African nations to vaccinate its officials.  The Minister of Defense, Mohamed Diane was the first to receive the vaccine. He was shown getting the inoculation on national TV followed by other Cabinet ministers receiving the shots on Wednesday.    Gen. Bourema Condé, Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, spoke after receiving the Russian vaccine.    “This new vaccine is a strong signal. This signal shows the strong will of the president. Today is a sampling, and this sampling will be duplicated,” he said. “The president wants all Guineans to be in good health in relation to this pandemic.”    Amadou Damaro Camara, the president of the country’s legislative body, the National Assembly, was also vaccinated.    “We are the guinea pigs,” he said of receiving the first doses of the vaccine.    “It is the government’s permanent concern to want to fight against this disease and we are very happy about it,” he said. “We hope that this vaccination will be extended to the rest of the people and that it will be the beginning of the eradication of this disease.”  Tibou Camara, Guinea’s industry minister, also spoke on the television broadcast after being vaccinated.    “The Guinean population should be congratulated and rejoice at a time when the vaccine is coveted and not very accessible to many countries, and that our country is a beneficiary,” he said.    Russia has businesses in the West African nation and Guinea is known for its bauxite mining.

A Government spokesman said that at present, there are over 2 000 other visitors who are holding valid travel documents and have to continue to stay in Hong Kong owing to the COVID-19 epidemic. On public health considerations, providing vaccination for these other visitors will help prevent the spread of the virus in the community and thus enhance Hong Kong's overall anti-epidemic capability.           Other visitors who will be covered by the Vaccination Programme must be holders of valid travel documents who are allowed to stay in Hong Kong as permitted by the law, and can complete two doses of vaccination within their limit of stay without extension. From July 6, they can bring their travel documents and the landing slips or extension of stay labels (applicable to other visitors with extension of stay) issued by the Immigration Department to any post office (except mobile post offices) during office hours and the staff will assist them in making appointments for completing two doses of vaccination in the 29 Community Vaccination Centres within their limit of stay.              In general, all visitors to Hong Kong must depart Hong Kong on or before the expiry date of their limit of stay. If there is a special or urgent need to stay longer, visitors may make an extension of stay application within seven days before their limit of stay expires.

Residents who are not participants in the Hungarian State Health Insurance program (“TAJ”) will be prioritized after those who are program participants.    Starting on May 4, foreign citizens living in Hungary without TAJ cards can now register for COVID vaccinations here: https://vakcinainfo.gov.hu/.

The vaccine is being sold at a maximum retail price of ?995 per dose.  The use of the vaccine follows clearance for the imported doses from the Central Drugs Laboratory in Kasauli on Thursday. Sputnik V that last month was accorded emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller General of India... .  Members of the senior leadership of Dr. Reddy’s said the vaccine will be supplied at the same price —?948 plus 5% GST — to both government and private sector. For the consumers, there would also be administering charges levied by hospitals. Given that the vaccine must be stored at minus 18 degrees C and the lack of availability of such cold chain infrastructure, the company said, “We will begin with Metros and Tier 1 cities and scale up to the rest of India.”   In the run up to the launch, the company’s leadership had said the cost of imported Sputnik V, which is a two dose vaccine, in India would hover around the $10 a dose at which it was priced in other global markets by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).  Co-Chairman and Managing Director G.V. Prasad said, “We are prioritising our efforts to launch Sputnik V vaccine across India.” Dr. Reddy’s was also in discussion with a couple of State governments for vaccine offtake.""    ---------------    ""On 19 April, it was announced that the next phase of the vaccine program would begin on 1 May, extending eligibility to all residents over the age of 18.

This includes frontline healthcare workers, older adults above the age of 60 and people with underlying health conditions.

But first, he is organizing surveys to see who in the Andavadoaka region, if anyone, is willing to get the vaccine. If enough people want a jab, the team will raise funds to hire a helicopter to bring in doses. But there hasn’t yet been enough interest. This seems to be a pattern around the country. Madagascar received 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine in May through the COVAX programme — an alliance of international organizations that aims to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries — but health officials administered only 190,000 of the doses before they expired on 17 June, because not enough people turned up to receive them. Michel Saint-Lot, a representative of the development and humanitarian aid organization UNICEF Madagascar, anticipates another vaccine shipment from COVAX in August, which will be necessary for vaccinated individuals to get their second dose. “We’re confident these things can be overcome, and we’ll step up the campaign,” he says. “We hope the full government will join us to get the country immunized.”""""    https://web.archive.org/web/20210725212859/https://mg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/covid-19-information/    https://web.archive.org/web/20210726050147/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01933-9"""

Aniette Patrick, journalist, says she thinks the issue of trust is a major challenge for most Nigerians because leadership has been a major challenge and people tend not to trust the system in place despite the campaigns and enlightenment.    “In Nigeria, I guess nonchalant attitude is one thing and lack of trust is another, people feel what the government is giving as vaccines may not be the same thing others are receiving, that is the common man understanding and I think that is the major factor,” she added.    Experts say vaccine hesitancy will not only threaten COVID-19 response but prevent Nigeria from achieving herd immunity.    The Public Relation officer, National Hospital, Abuja Tayo Haastrup reiterated that the Covid 19 response was first launched in National Hospital by the Federal government and on record, the first Doctor in Nigeria to take the vaccination in the center, is from the Hospital with two of their nurses.    Well within the first two weeks, we had a large turnout of people coming to take the vaccination and we created two venues for the vaccination. At the trauma center, we created some rooms there and we also we created another    “I am sure it was because of the awareness and media support within the period that encouraged people to come out for the vaccination but at today, the turnout is decreasing not as populated as it used to be when we started,” he said.    Chief consultant National Hospital, Abuja, Dr Rais Ibrahim, says as a healthcare provider, he has taken the vaccine so he can render his services to Nigerians adding that there is no pain and recommend everyone should get it.    ‘People are always resistant to change and something new but with time people will see the benefit of taking the vaccine so that you protect yourself and by extension protect your family,” he said.    A recent release by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, showed that only1, 043, 737 eligible Nigerians have so far been vaccinated with the first dose.

As of 18 February 2021, about 250,000 individuals have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Amongst them, more than 110,000 have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen. Following the successful pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, we will commence COVID-19 vaccinations for seniors in the community from 22 February.    3.    COVID-19 vaccination for seniors will commence island-wide from 22 February. Over the next three weeks, seniors aged 70 years and above can expect to receive personalised letters inviting them to sign up for vaccination. We will start by inviting seniors living near polyclinics or vaccination centres, so that they can be conveniently vaccinated at a vaccination site near their home. By mid-March when we have opened a vaccination centre in each town, all seniors will be able to receive their vaccination. We expect all the letters to reach our seniors aged 70 years and above by the first week of March.    4.    Thereafter we will move to vaccinate the seniors aged 60 to 69 years. They will receive their invitation letters around the middle of March, and the vaccination will commence from around end-March onwards.    8.   To ensure that seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations, we will set up more vaccination centres in the coming weeks. Currently, there are 11 vaccination centres in operation[3]. Three more vaccination centres located at community centres/clubs will commence operations by 22 February, at Bukit Timah, Marine Parade and Taman Jurong, bringing the total to 14. By the middle of March, 31 vaccination centres will be in operation, with at least one vaccination centre in each town. In total, there will eventually be around 40 vaccination centres, with each vaccination centre planned for an estimated capacity of 2,000 vaccinations per day.    http://archive.today/2021.02.22-144640/https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/start-of-covid-19-vaccination-for-seniors    Coding note: the code for H7 was previously changed from 1G to 2G on 27th January in response to the pilot vaccination programme for elderly groups at Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar."

This conclusion is based on the data from the original mRNA trials, which has been bolstered recently by emerging information from real-world observations, laboratory studies and simulations.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) will work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) on vaccination for this school-going age group and provide further updates in due course.

However, from the Prime Minister's speech dated 31 May 2021 regarding updates on Singapore's Covid management, some additions to the current processes are underway, which may see some coding changes in the coming weeks.    Individuals who have not been allowed to obtain the vaccines through the government scheme due to reasons such as other co-morbidities, vulnerable conditions such as pregnancy or pre-existing allergies will soon be allowed to obtain alternative WHO-approved vaccines through the private sector. Some of these cases might soon be allowed to obtain the 2 currently available vaccines in Singapore (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech), although this is pending an expert review. These vaccines include those by Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Sinopharm - although these are not yet currently in circulation in the country (this will change in the coming weeks). The review is reported to take approximately 2 weeks, so by mid to late June, we may see some coding changes to H7 for Singapore.  ________________________  Quote (1):  ""Third, we will vaccinate more people, and faster. We have made good progress since vaccinations started in December. Our healthcare and frontline workers, and the majority of those 45 and above, have already received at least their first dose. These are the ones more at risk from COVID-19. Now, vaccination of those aged 40 to 44 is under way.    The MTF recently announced that we would speed up vaccinations in the next two months, and prioritise first dose vaccinations. This is in progress. We want to protect as many Singaporeans as possible, and as soon as we can, especially with the new COVID-19 variants. This approach will quickly provide the maximum number of people with good protection, instead of a good number of people with maximum protection.    We are vaccinating as many people as our supplies allow. Our 40 vaccination centres island-wide are running smoothly. The constraint is vaccine supply. This is why we have been working very hard to confirm and speed up deliveries of vaccines from our suppliers.    I am happy to report that since the last update by the MTF, we have received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months. With the latest supply schedule, we can further boost our vaccination programme. We can offer the vaccine to everyone, even sooner than we expected.    The next group to be vaccinated will be students. In this latest outbreak, we have seen more cases of children getting infected, in schools and tuition centres. The children were not seriously ill, but parents are naturally worried. Therefore, we will take full advantage of the June holidays to vaccinate students. Bookings will open tomorrow. We will give priority to the graduating cohorts for ‘O’, ‘N’, and ‘A’ Levels, as well as special needs students. Then the other students 12 years and above will take their turn, including students in our Institutes of Higher Learning.    After the students, we will vaccinate the final remaining group, young adults 39 years and younger. This should start around mid-June. This group is quite large. Therefore, we will give the Singaporeans among them a two-week priority window to book your appointments first, before we open up to the rest who want to be vaccinated.""

""However, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday that after an extensive review, more people will be able to get the mRNA vaccines. These include pregnant or breastfeeding women, cancer patients receiving treatment and those with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.

Such use of SAR  for these unregistered pandemic vaccines will be time-limited, for the duration of the pandemic.  The vaccines by Johnson & Johnson and Oxford-AstraZena, which are viral vector vaccines, have been linked to reports of extremely rare but potentially life-threatening blood clots.

""The Government will not subsidise vaccines administered under the SAR, and persons vaccinated under the process will not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for Covid-19 Vaccination.""    ""In another move aimed at allowing more people here to be vaccinated, MOH said it is reviewing its current position where those with known anaphylaxis are restricted from taking either of the two mRNA vaccines approved for use here.  These vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are very safe and have a very high efficacy rate of 95 per cent and 94 per cent respectively. However, more than 30,000 individuals are unable to take these two vaccines due to medical reasons, said Mr Ong.  He noted that some people want alternate vaccines because of their history of anaphylaxis, which restricts them from taking mRNA vaccines. The expert committee on Covid-19 vaccination is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mRNA vaccine or its components, but other substances like seafood, painkiller and antibiotics.

An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to registrants progressively to invite them to book their appointments. Those who had registered their interest earlier will not need to register again. Parental Consent Required for Persons Below 18 Years Old. Those who are under the age of 18 will require the consent of their parent/guardian to book an appointment. The child will be required to bring along documentary proof of their consent to the vaccination site for verification. Parents/guardians of children/wards aged 13 and above are not required to accompany them to the vaccination site on the day of vaccination, However, children/wards aged 12 will need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.      2. Individuals who have recovered from an earlier infection    Individuals who have recovered from an earlier COVID-19 infection are recommended to receive a single dose of vaccine. Evidence has indicated that a single dose would further boost their immunity against COVID-19. Individuals who had an earlier COVID-19 infection from over six months ago will be prioritised for the single-dose vaccination, as recovered individuals who have had infection within the past six months are likely to still have a strong immune response that has not faded. Eligible persons will be able to register from 11 June 2021 onwards, if they are part of a population group that is already eligible for vaccination. Vaccination remains a key enabler in keeping our community safe. Those who are medically eligible are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated when it is offered to you.

Pregnant women are also not able to obtain the vaccines if they want to - although for these women, the age group roll out phases still apply, i.e. those 39 and below will only be able to start registering their interests from mid-June.    Due to recent spikes in educational institutions, Covid vaccines drives for school aged children between the ages of 12-17 years have begun on June 1. This is also following the recent approval of the use of these vaccines in the same group.    Individuals who have a medical history of allergic reactions are also now able to obtain the vaccines; however, those with a medical history of allergic reactions to other vaccines are still not allowed to be vaccinated with the covid vaccine (this sub-group of individuals might be allowed the vaccine before the end of the year, pending further expert reviews of the vaccine)     A recent announcement was also made to focus on the first dose of the vaccine so that a greater number of people can be vaccinated with at least the first dose as the government continues to work on its vaccine supply chain.    According to the age group roll out phases, a coding change for H7 should be happening in the coming weeks.  ________________________________  Quote (1):  ""Covid-19 vaccination exercise for S'pore students to begin June 1; those 39 and below can register from mid-June.

This restriction will be removed from Saturday (June 5). A large majority of the 32,000 people here who have not been able to take the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines because of medical reasons will now be able to do so under the national programme, MOH said. But a minority with a history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions to other vaccines will still not be eligible. Another 2,000 people who developed allergic reactions after receiving the first dose of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine should not receive an mRNA-based vaccine again, the ministry added.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) will now also allow Covid-19 vaccines that are approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation (WHO), it said on Monday. Besides Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the WHO has also green-lit the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Indian Covishield vaccines. But individuals who want to take these shots will do so at their own cost and risk - in contrast with the official vaccine roll-out, which is free for all long-term residents. The government will not subsidise vaccines given under the Special Access Route (SAR), and those who get such vaccines are not eligible for the scheme that grants one-time goodwill financial assistance for serious vaccine side effects. The MOH noted that ""there has been interest to access alternate vaccines used in other countries"", especially for those with medical conditions, such as pregnancy or life-threatening allergies; these individuals were previously excluded from the two mRNA vaccines. ""However, there have either been no applications for approval of these alternate vaccines in Singapore, or evaluation is still ongoing,"" it added, referring to the vaccine, which is not yet approved by the Health Sciences Authority.
