Gould Jr., announced funding for active transportation and social infrastructure for the Abegweit First Nation community.    Investments will support the implementation of the Abegweit Connects project which will build active transportation infrastructure to connect the First Nation community to the Hillsborough River and the Confederation Trail. This project includes the construction of several structures to create a safe and direct access to the waterfront and multi-use trail. This initiative will provide the community with new opportunities to remain active, and reconnect residents with the Hillsborough River, which was an essential transportation route and food source for past generations. This project will also encourage new economic development initiatives for Abegweit First Nation, as well as support the pandemic response and economic recovery efforts.    The Province of Prince Edward Island is providing approximately 15 acres of land, on the south side of Route 2, to the Abegweit First Nation for the nominal fee of one dollar. This land conveyance will support the Abegweit Connects project and the community’s plans for future development.    Additional funding will also support the preparation of plans, specifications and cost estimates for the development of the Epekwitk Mena'taqug Centre set for construction this year in Scotchfort. The new Centre will improve access as well as the quality of community, cultural, and recreational infrastructure in the community. The new community building will be built thanks to funding from the Government of Canada announced in August 2019 (link is external).

The changes are that fully vaccinated residents will not have to undergo quarantine upon return from a day or overnight trip away from the facility. They must still pass a COVID-19 health screening though. If they don't pass the screening, or if they are returning from an international trip, a close contact of a positive case, or are returning from a unit that has an outbreak, they must still quarantine. Non-vaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals still need to follow the quarantine and twice-daily symptom checks.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210524200822/https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/fully-vaccinated-seniors-in-alberta-long-term-care-homes-will-no-longer-have-to-quarantine-after-overnight-outings-if-they-are-vaccinated-and-test-negative"
