RT-PCR testing continues to be only available for symptomatic individuals, those under mandatory self-isolation for entry into Northwest Territories, and those as directed by Public Health via contact tracing efforts. If Public Health of NWT has not been in contact and if there are no symptoms, testing is discouraged until symptoms emerge. Guidance is also in place to test symptomatic students and teachers for return-to-school. Appointments are required to access testing.  Due to the faster turnaround time, rapid tests are available for those assessed as requiring a COVID-19 test in all NWT communities and all positive tests will be confirmed by RT-PCR testing.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210705222252/https://www.nthssa.ca/en/covid-testing  https://web.archive.org/web/20210705222327/https://www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/en/services/about-covid-19/testing  https://web.archive.org/web/20210614181821/https://www.nthssa.ca/en/newsroom/rapid-covid-19-testing-now-available-all-nwt-communities  https://web.archive.org/web/20210524225330/https://www.nthssa.ca/en/newsroom/public-notice-%E2%80%93-testing-return-school-symptomatic-individuals"
