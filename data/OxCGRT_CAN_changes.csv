Given the high number of cases, the Government of Canada has taken additional measures:    Transport Canada has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) to suspend all commercial and private passenger flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days, effective 23:30 EDT April 22, 2021.  The Minister of Transport will amend the Interim Order Respecting Certain Requirements for Civil Aviation Due to COVID-19, which means for passengers who depart India or Pakistan to Canada after 23:30 EDT April 22, 2021, via an indirect route, they will need to obtain a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada.  These measures will help manage the elevated risk of imported cases of COVID-19 and variants of concern into Canada during a time of increasing pressure on our health care system.    https://archive.vn/YTXrb"

That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done in these unprecedented times.    Today, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence, and Member of Parliament for Cardigan, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, along with the Honourable Dennis King, Premier of Prince Edward Island and Abegweit First Nation Chief Roderick W. Gould Jr., announced funding for active transportation and social infrastructure for the Abegweit First Nation community.    Investments will support the implementation of the Abegweit Connects project which will build active transportation infrastructure to connect the First Nation community to the Hillsborough River and the Confederation Trail. This project includes the construction of several structures to create a safe and direct access to the waterfront and multi-use trail. This initiative will provide the community with new opportunities to remain active, and reconnect residents with the Hillsborough River, which was an essential transportation route and food source for past generations. This project will also encourage new economic development initiatives for Abegweit First Nation, as well as support the pandemic response and economic recovery efforts.    The Province of Prince Edward Island is providing approximately 15 acres of land, on the south side of Route 2, to the Abegweit First Nation for the nominal fee of one dollar. This land conveyance will support the Abegweit Connects project and the community’s plans for future development.    Additional funding will also support the preparation of plans, specifications and cost estimates for the development of the Epekwitk Mena'taqug Centre set for construction this year in Scotchfort. The new Centre will improve access as well as the quality of community, cultural, and recreational infrastructure in the community. The new community building will be built thanks to funding from the Government of Canada announced in August 2019 (link is external).

Those entering PEI more than once per week, who have not traveled outside Atlantic Canada in the previous 14 days, must be tested at least once every 5 days.  Members of the above groups will receive a rapid test. People who take a rapid test and receive a positive result will be called directly within two hours by the Chief Public Health Office.  Anyone who has a positive rapid test will be re-directed to a testing clinic to have a confirmatory PCR test.   Those who do not receive a call within two hours are considered to have a negative result.   All those tested will receive a card showing the date and time of their test.
