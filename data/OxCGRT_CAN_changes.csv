How to register for testing To get tested, complete an online self-assessment or contact Telecare 811 or your healthcare provider.” NB Public Health advises: “Rapid antigen testing devices may be used to screen for COVID-19 … all positive test results must be confirmed with a laboratory PCR test.” On 26 March 2021, NB introduced: “Workplace COVID-19 POCT [point of care testing] program … for testing of asymptomatic individuals, having passed the initial workplace screening conducted in the workplace.” The Abbott Panbio lateral flow test (LFT) is available in NB. In the latest data as of 29 May 2021, Health Canada has shipped 320,800 LFTs to NB, but only 8,149 (2.5%) have been used. 343,885 laboratory covid tests have been conducted in NB. NB’s approach could be described as: lateral flow testing (and other rapid testing) available to asymptomatic people, who work in eligible workplaces that have successfully applied to participate, and all positive LFTs will be followed up by a PCR test. In view of the predominance of PCR as the first step in NB’s testing process and limited use of LFTs, 2 based on PCR testing of symptomatic individuals still seems to be the most accurate coding for NB.
