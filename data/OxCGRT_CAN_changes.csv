Indoor gatherings in homes will be restricted to five people, plus those living in the home. This policy suggests gatherings indoors must still be small with no more than 5 outside guests - and will most likely be smaller than 11 in practice. Furthermore, indoor gatherings outside of dwellings, such as group counselling or support groups are specifically restricted to 10. As we code the most stringent policy, this has therefore been coded as 4T. A side note, the Government also recommends that those in Arviat create bubbles of 2 households.    In all other areas of Nunavut (Chesterfield Inlet, Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Naujaat, Rankin Inlet,  Whale Cove, Baffin, and Kitikmeot), outdoor gatherings are restricted to 100 people, while indoor gatherings are restricted to a household plus 15 people. Individuals must maintain a distance of 2m from others in public who are not members of their immediate household.

Further information on exemptions will be available in the coming days.    In addition, as of February 22, 2021, travellers entering Canada at the land border will be required to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival as well as toward the end of their 14-day quarantine. The Government of Canada will run 16 testing sites at point of entry across Canada. Five ports of entry will initially be available (see below) with 11 additional as of March 4 (see below). The Government of Canada is also working to supply all other ports of entry with test kits for travellers to take to meet these requirements.    For travellers arriving to Canada by air    As of February 22, 2021, all air travellers, with some exceptions, will be required to take a COVID-19 molecular test when they arrive in Canada before exiting the airport, and another toward the end of their 14-day quarantine period. With limited exceptions, air travellers, will also be required to reserve prior to departure to Canada, a 3-night stay in a government-authorized hotel. Travellers will be required to stay at their reserved hotel for up to 3 nights, at their own cost, while they await the results of their arrival test.    Hotel booking information will be available online as of February 18, 2021. Travellers will need to book a hotel in the city in which they first arrive in Canada. If they receive a negative result on their arrival test, they will be able to take a connecting flight to their final destination. There will be a number of hotels to choose from near each of the four international airports accepting international flights, in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. Costs of these hotel stays may vary slightly at each location. It is up to the traveller to choose where they wish to stay and book in advance of departure. The price will include costs associated with the room, food, cleaning, infection prevention and control measures, and security as well as transportation.    These new measures are in addition to existing mandatory pre-boarding and health requirements for air travellers.    Finally, at the same time on February 22, 2021, all travellers, whether arriving by land or air will be required to submit their travel and contact information, including a suitable quarantine plan, electronically via ArriveCAN before crossing the border or boarding a flight. All travellers arriving to Canada must also continue to submit COVID-related information electronically daily throughout the quarantine period. For a quarantine location to be deemed suitable, travellers cannot stay with at-risk subpopulations including people who work in hospitals or long-term care facilities, adults over the age of 65, or those who are immunocompromised or at risk for more severe disease outcomes. In addition, travellers must avoid all contact with other in their household with whom they did not travel.    The Government of Canada continues to strongly advise Canadians to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel, including vacation plans, outside Canada. Foreign nationals should likewise postpone or cancel travel plans to Canada. Now is not the time to travel.    https://archive.vn/wip/2DiVS"

Many travelers arriving in PEI (ex: rotational workers) are required to get tested on day 0-1, 4-6, and 9-11 when they arrive in PEI. The pilot would allow them to receive their first test at the airport. The requirement to follow isolation protocols following travel into Prince Edward Island remains in place.    The Chief Public Health Office and Health PEI will run the pilot project for a four week period at the Charlottetown Airport, offering PoC COVID screening to arriving travelers beginning on Tuesday, February 23. Two swabs will be provided, one PoC and one lab test for confirmation. By participating in the pilot testing project, travelers arriving by air can be swabbed for their first test at the airport. Participants in the pilot study who are required to get tested again at days 4-6 and 9-11 after arrival will be able to access the additional testing at one of PEI’s drop-in testing clinics.     “The process of testing at the airport will make testing more convenient and faster for any incoming travelers,” said Charlottetown Airport CEO, Doug Newson. “We are very pleased to work with the Chief Public Health Office, Health PEI and Island EMS to provide this service to simplify testing for incoming travelers while also helping to control the importation and spread of COVID-19.”    PoC tests have been used in PEI to support targeted testing of 20 to 29 year olds and testing among members of the province’s homeless population. These rapid tests would also be used as part of an outbreak response.     Prince Edward Island has one active case of COVID-19 and has had a total of 115 positive cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic.
