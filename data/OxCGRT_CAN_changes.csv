Today, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence, and Member of Parliament for Cardigan, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, along with the Honourable Dennis King, Premier of Prince Edward Island and Abegweit First Nation Chief Roderick W. Gould Jr., announced funding for active transportation and social infrastructure for the Abegweit First Nation community.    Investments will support the implementation of the Abegweit Connects project which will build active transportation infrastructure to connect the First Nation community to the Hillsborough River and the Confederation Trail. This project includes the construction of several structures to create a safe and direct access to the waterfront and multi-use trail. This initiative will provide the community with new opportunities to remain active, and reconnect residents with the Hillsborough River, which was an essential transportation route and food source for past generations. This project will also encourage new economic development initiatives for Abegweit First Nation, as well as support the pandemic response and economic recovery efforts.    The Province of Prince Edward Island is providing approximately 15 acres of land, on the south side of Route 2, to the Abegweit First Nation for the nominal fee of one dollar. This land conveyance will support the Abegweit Connects project and the community’s plans for future development.    Additional funding will also support the preparation of plans, specifications and cost estimates for the development of the Epekwitk Mena'taqug Centre set for construction this year in Scotchfort. The new Centre will improve access as well as the quality of community, cultural, and recreational infrastructure in the community. The new community building will be built thanks to funding from the Government of Canada announced in August 2019 (link is external).

Providing fast and accurate COVID-19 tests for people entering the province is important to protect PEI from importation of the virus, while maintaining resources and services on PEI.”  Effective Monday, April 26, all PEI resident registered truck drivers, rotational workers, transport crews, military and coast guard (regardless of where they travel) must isolate until they receive their first negative test, unless they are eligible for a same day travel self-isolation exemption.   Also effective April 26, for people work isolating in PEI following arrival from within the Atlantic Provinces, a negative test result is required before entering all workplaces.  Those entering PEI more than once per week, who have not traveled outside Atlantic Canada in the previous 14 days, must be tested at least once every 5 days.  Members of the above groups will receive a rapid test. People who take a rapid test and receive a positive result will be called directly within two hours by the Chief Public Health Office.  Anyone who has a positive rapid test will be re-directed to a testing clinic to have a confirmatory PCR test.   Those who do not receive a call within two hours are considered to have a negative result.   All those tested will receive a card showing the date and time of their test. Employers who require proof of testing before allowing an employee to work following travel may refer to the testing card, noting the time of the test.   Travelers who arrive via the airport will be given instructions for testing when they arrive and will receive tests at the 64 Park Street testing clinic in Charlottetown, the Slemon Park testing clinic or one of the other testing clinics across the province.  https://archive.vn/NZvQn#selection-2167.0-2206.0  https://archive.vn/NZvQn"
