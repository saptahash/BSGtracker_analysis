The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) are reminding travellers and returning Canadian residents about what to expect at the border.    Travellers should be aware of the following mandatory requirements to help with smooth processing at the Canadian border. Planning ahead can help travellers avoid potential complications, delays at the border, and fines. A number of Canadians may have already received a COVID-19 vaccination. At this time, having a vaccination does not exempt anyone from having to comply with current testing, quarantine, and other requirements.    Travellers must:    Use ArriveCAN to provide COVID-19-related information. Before boarding a flight to Canada or arriving at a land border crossing, travellers must electronically submit the following information using the ArriveCAN mobile app or by signing in online at Canada.ca/ArriveCAN.    travel and contact information;  quarantine plan (unless exempt); and,  COVID-19 symptom self-assessment.  Travellers flying to Canada must also submit their reference code for a confirmed three-night reservation at a government-authorized hotel.       Get tested before travelling to Canada. Unless exempt, all travellers five years of age or older entering Canada by air or land need to show proof of a:    negative COVID-19 molecular test (not an antigen test) result taken within 72 hours before their scheduled flight or arrival at the land border crossing; or  positive COVID-19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days before their scheduled flight or arrival at the land border crossing.   Airlines may refuse boarding to travellers that are unable to provide a valid molecular test result. Antigen tests are not accepted. For travellers arriving at a land border crossing, their COVID-19 molecular test must have been performed in the U.S.    Get tested when arriving in Canada.    If flying, travellers will be required to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival to Canada, before leaving the airport. They will also be provided with a COVID-19 specimen collection kit to use for their test on day 10 of their mandatory quarantine. Travellers are encouraged to register for their arrival test in advance to save time at the airport. They must also register their Day 10 kit on their first day in Canada.  If driving, travellers will be provided two COVID-19 specimen collection kits upon entry to Canada: one to use on the day they arrive in Canada, and another to use on day 10 of their mandatory quarantine. Some land border crossings offer on-site services to help guide travellers through the specimen collection process. Travellers should create an account for their test kits through the Switch Health portal before arriving at a land border crossing. This will help save time as they move through the specimen collection process on-arrival.   Complete their day 10 test and quarantine.    Travellers flying into Canada must proceed to their pre-booked hotel to await results of their arrival test. If negative, they can go directly to their place of quarantine to complete the rest of their 14-day quarantine. If positive, they will be relocated to a designated quarantine facility or other suitable place of isolation.  Travellers driving into Canada must go directly to their place of quarantine to complete their 14-day quarantine.  All travellers will be required to contact Switch Health to schedule a telehealth appointment for their day 10 test. A health care professional will guide travellers through the specimen collection process, which includes taking a nasal swab, packaging it for testing, and arranging for it to be picked up and couriered to a laboratory.  If a traveller receives a negative test result, they may only leave their place of quarantine once they have completed their full 14-day quarantine period. If a traveller receives a positive test result, they must quarantine for an additional 14-day period from the day the sample was collected.   On the day after entering Canada, all travellers must use ArriveCAN or call the 1-833-641-0343 toll-free number to confirm that they have arrived at a government-authorized hotel or the address they provided for their place of quarantine or isolation. Travellers must also complete a daily COVID-19 symptom self-assessment during their 14-day quarantine period.     Note that the province or territory of the traveller’s final destination may have additional restrictions.    Quick facts  Due to enhanced screening measures at the border, travellers may experience longer delays.    As of February 12, 2021, if you drive back to Canada with your US-plated vehicle, you have 30 days to either export it or permanently import it.    All Customs Act rules still apply. Returning Canadian residents must declare all goods they acquired while outside Canada, including purchases and gifts that they have with them or that are being shipped to them. They must also declare any restricted or prohibited goods in their possession (including food, plant, and animal products) and repairs or alterations they made to their vehicle while out of the country. Please have receipts ready.    Travellers are informed upon entry of the compliance monitoring and verification activities, which include emails, calls from an agent, interactive automated calls, as well as in-person visits to verify compliance with the federal emergency order. Travellers are also informed upon entry of the possible consequences of non-compliance, and the enforcement actions and penalties they could face.    The Contraventions Act provides police (including Royal Canadian Mounted Police [RCMP], provincial and local police), PHAC Quarantine Officers and Screening Officers, and other enforcement officers with additional tools to enforce the Quarantine Act. The fines associated with contravention tickets range from $825-$3,000 for each instance of non-compliance.    For example:  Travellers who refuse to take a COVID-19 molecular test at the airport upon arrival could receive a fine of $3,000.  An individual who leaves their place of quarantine prior to the end of the 14th day of quarantine could be fined $3,000 for each day that they are found to be in non-compliance.   Individuals who contravene the mandatory isolation or mandatory quarantine requirements, including the instructions of a Quarantine Officer, may be subject to a range of enforcement measures under the Quarantine Act. Maximum penalties include a fine of up to $750,000 and/or imprisonment for six months. "

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) are reminding travellers and returning Canadian residents about what to expect at the border.    Travellers should be aware of the following mandatory requirements to help with smooth processing at the Canadian border. Planning ahead can help travellers avoid potential complications, delays at the border, and fines. A number of Canadians may have already received a COVID-19 vaccination. At this time, having a vaccination does not exempt anyone from having to comply with current testing, quarantine, and other requirements.    Travellers must:    Use ArriveCAN to provide COVID-19-related information. Before boarding a flight to Canada or arriving at a land border crossing, travellers must electronically submit the following information using the ArriveCAN mobile app or by signing in online at Canada.ca/ArriveCAN.    travel and contact information;  quarantine plan (unless exempt); and,  COVID-19 symptom self-assessment.

Airlines may refuse boarding to travellers that are unable to provide a valid molecular test result. Antigen tests are not accepted. For travellers arriving at a land border crossing, their COVID-19 molecular test must have been performed in the U.S.    Get tested when arriving in Canada.    If flying, travellers will be required to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival to Canada, before leaving the airport. They will also be provided with a COVID-19 specimen collection kit to use for their test on day 10 of their mandatory quarantine. Travellers are encouraged to register for their arrival test in advance to save time at the airport. They must also register their Day 10 kit on their first day in Canada.

Travellers should create an account for their test kits through the Switch Health portal before arriving at a land border crossing. This will help save time as they move through the specimen collection process on-arrival.   Complete their day 10 test and quarantine.    Travellers flying into Canada must proceed to their pre-booked hotel to await results of their arrival test.

If a traveller receives a negative test result, they may only leave their place of quarantine once they have completed their full 14-day quarantine period. If a traveller receives a positive test result, they must quarantine for an additional 14-day period from the day the sample was collected.

"259","Ontario","CAN_ON","24-Mar-21","E3_Fiscal measures",0,NA,5689487514,NA,"""""Protecting Our Economy is the second pillar of the 2021 Budget. It outlines Ontario's plan to support families, workers and employers.    “The necessary public health measures have come at a cost for workers, families and business owners, but there is no question that they have saved lives,” said Minister Bethlenfalvy. “We recognize the sacrifices that have been made. We are taking further steps to provide additional relief and support to those who have been most impacted by the pandemic, including providing a third round of direct payments to parents, doubling the Ontario Small Business Support Grant, and helping workers with their training expenses.”    Highlights of Ontario's plan to support workers and families:    To help workers with their training expenses, the government is proposing a new Ontario Jobs Training Tax Credit for 2021. It would provide up to $2,000 per recipient for 50 per cent of eligible expenses, for a total of an estimated $260 million in support to about 230,000 people in 2021.  To help families — who have faced new pressures and expenses due to the pandemic — keep more money in their pockets, the government is providing a third round of payments to support parents through the Ontario COVID-19 Child Benefit, totalling $1.8 billion since last March. The payment will be doubled to $400 per child for this round and $500 for each child with special needs, which means a family with three young children, one of whom has special needs, will receive $2,600 in total after the third round of payments.  To support parents with the cost of child care and help them get back to the workforce, the government is proposing a 20 per cent enhancement of the CARE tax credit for 2021. This would increase support from $1,250 to $1,500, on average, providing about  $75 million in additional support for the child care expenses of over 300,000 families.  Highlights of Ontario's plan to support jobs:    To help small businesses that have been most affected by the necessary restrictions to protect people from COVID-19, Ontario is providing a second round of Ontario Small Business Support Grant payments to eligible recipients. Approximately 120,000 small businesses will automatically benefit from an additional $1.7 billion in relief through this second round of support in the form of grants of a minimum of $10,000 and up to $20,000 — bringing the estimated total support provided through this grant to $3.4 billion.  To support Ontario's tourism, hospitality and culture industries that have been among the most heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario is investing an additional $400 million over the next three years in new initiatives to support these sectors. This builds on previously announced investments of $225 million, bringing the total to more than $625 million since the pandemic began.  To connect homes, businesses and communities to broadband — which COVID-19 has demonstrated is a necessity, not a luxury — Ontario is investing $2.8 billion, bringing the Province's total investment to nearly $4 billion over six years beginning 2019–20.  Highlights of Ontario's plan to support communities:    To support faith-based and cultural organizations that are struggling due to the additional costs caused by COVID-19, Ontario will be making up to $50 million available for grants to eligible organizations.  To support Ontario's 444 municipalities, the Province's key partners in the fight against COVID-19, the government is providing almost $1 billion in additional financial relief in 2021 to help preserve vital public services and support economic recovery.""""

An essential visitor is an individual considered, by the residents care team, to be paramount to the resident’s physical care and mental well-being, including assistance with feeding, mobility, personal care, communication assistance, or assistance with significant behavioural symptoms; Ensure residents who are admitted from the community or acute care undergo screening, testing and isolation prior to admission to the home or facility; Ensure anyone who enters the home or facility is screened before entry; Ensure that staff are only shared between other homes or facilities in urgent situations.” Still consistent with coding “3=extensive protections”.

The same restrictions are in place on visitors in long-term care facilities in the Yukon.     Residents are still allowed to have 4 identified general visitors for indoor visits. 2 identified general visitors can visit at the same time if they are members of the same household. These identified general visitors should not change regularly.     Where indoor visits are taking place, there is strict protocol that must be followed. Visitors must:  .Stay home if symptoms are present;  .Not visit if they have travelled outside the territory in the past 14 days;  .Sign in;  .Undergo a Covid-19 screening questionnaire and temperature check;  .Wear a medical mask continuously;  .Remain in the resident’s room for the duration of the visit;  .Not visit any other residents;  .Avoid touching share equipment (e.g. linen carts);  .Wear any personal protective equipment, as may be required; and  .Wash hands or use sanitizer on entry/exit from the building and entry/exit from rooms.

"458","Newfoundland and Labrador","CAN_NL","27-Mar-21","H8_Protection of elderly people",3,"G",2,"G","Effective 27 March 2021, in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), “the Special Measures Orders for personal care homes, long-term care homes and assisted living facilities … will be repealed. This means visitation within these facilities will increase to a maximum of six designated visitors.” However, it remains the case: “Operators of personal care homes, long term care facilities, and assisted living facilities must ensure that staff are only shared between other homes or facilities in urgent situations where direct care of residents will be adversely affected.” The combination of a more relaxed visitor limit with workers restricted to a single long-term care facility is judged to be consistent with 2 = narrow protections.

Measures are still in place to protect the elderly.     The changes include:     Family/social visits are no longer limited to one designated family member or friend.     Up to two adults and one child can visit with a resident indoors at a time. Residents may have more social visitors outdoors, in an appropriate location, and in alignment with current provincial health officer guidelines.    Family and friends can visit in residents’ rooms or in designated common areas without staff present.    There are no longer restrictions on the frequency or duration of visits.  Physical touch between residents and their visitors is allowed with infection prevention and control measures, like masks and hand hygiene, in place.    Every resident is entitled to regular, routine, frequent opportunities for social visitation, allowing for a minimum of 60 minutes if desired.
