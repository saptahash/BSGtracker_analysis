The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) are reminding travellers and returning Canadian residents about what to expect at the border.    Travellers should be aware of the following mandatory requirements to help with smooth processing at the Canadian border. Planning ahead can help travellers avoid potential complications, delays at the border, and fines. A number of Canadians may have already received a COVID-19 vaccination. At this time, having a vaccination does not exempt anyone from having to comply with current testing, quarantine, and other requirements.    Travellers must:    Use ArriveCAN to provide COVID-19-related information. Before boarding a flight to Canada or arriving at a land border crossing, travellers must electronically submit the following information using the ArriveCAN mobile app or by signing in online at Canada.ca/ArriveCAN.    travel and contact information;  quarantine plan (unless exempt); and,  COVID-19 symptom self-assessment.

Airlines may refuse boarding to travellers that are unable to provide a valid molecular test result. Antigen tests are not accepted. For travellers arriving at a land border crossing, their COVID-19 molecular test must have been performed in the U.S.    Get tested when arriving in Canada.    If flying, travellers will be required to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival to Canada, before leaving the airport.

Travellers should create an account for their test kits through the Switch Health portal before arriving at a land border crossing. This will help save time as they move through the specimen collection process on-arrival.   Complete their day 10 test and quarantine.    Travellers flying into Canada must proceed to their pre-booked hotel to await results of their arrival test. If negative, they can go directly to their place of quarantine to complete the rest of their 14-day quarantine. If positive, they will be relocated to a designated quarantine facility or other suitable place of isolation.  Travellers driving into Canada must go directly to their place of quarantine to complete their 14-day quarantine.  All travellers will be required to contact Switch Health to schedule a telehealth appointment for their day 10 test. A health care professional will guide travellers through the specimen collection process, which includes taking a nasal swab, packaging it for testing, and arranging for it to be picked up and couriered to a laboratory.  If a traveller receives a negative test result, they may only leave their place of quarantine once they have completed their full 14-day quarantine period. If a traveller receives a positive test result, they must quarantine for an additional 14-day period from the day the sample was collected.   On the day after entering Canada, all travellers must use ArriveCAN or call the 1-833-641-0343 toll-free number to confirm that they have arrived at a government-authorized hotel or the address they provided for their place of quarantine or isolation. Travellers must also complete a daily COVID-19 symptom self-assessment during their 14-day quarantine period.     Note that the province or territory of the traveller’s final destination may have additional restrictions.    Quick facts  Due to enhanced screening measures at the border, travellers may experience longer delays.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) are reminding travellers and returning Canadian residents about what to expect at the border.    Travellers should be aware of the following mandatory requirements to help with smooth processing at the Canadian border. Planning ahead can help travellers avoid potential complications, delays at the border, and fines. A number of Canadians may have already received a COVID-19 vaccination.

Travellers driving into Canada must go directly to their place of quarantine to complete their 14-day quarantine.  All travellers will be required to contact Switch Health to schedule a telehealth appointment for their day 10 test.

If a traveller receives a negative test result, they may only leave their place of quarantine once they have completed their full 14-day quarantine period. If a traveller receives a positive test result, they must quarantine for an additional 14-day period from the day the sample was collected.   On the day after entering Canada, all travellers must use ArriveCAN or call the 1-833-641-0343 toll-free number to confirm that they have arrived at a government-authorized hotel or the address they provided for their place of quarantine or isolation. Travellers must also complete a daily COVID-19 symptom self-assessment during their 14-day quarantine period.     Note that the province or territory of the traveller’s final destination may have additional restrictions.

Enhanced COVID-19 testing will be provided in Borden, Slemon Park, and Charlottetown for workers and commercial truckers starting Monday, with reduced turnaround times for test results.    “All members of the border and testing teams have worked hard this weekend to ensure Prince Edward Island border testing is in place and ready to provide quick testing results to those who must travel to the Island,” said Marion Dowling, COVID-19 Joint Response Team Co-Lead. “Many of the people we test at the border are providing essential services to PEI. Providing fast and accurate COVID-19 tests for people entering the province is important to protect PEI from importation of the virus, while maintaining resources and services on PEI.”  Effective Monday, April 26, all PEI resident registered truck drivers, rotational workers, transport crews, military and coast guard (regardless of where they travel) must isolate until they receive their first negative test, unless they are eligible for a same day travel self-isolation exemption.   Also effective April 26, for people work isolating in PEI following arrival from within the Atlantic Provinces, a negative test result is required before entering all workplaces.  Those entering PEI more than once per week, who have not traveled outside Atlantic Canada in the previous 14 days, must be tested at least once every 5 days.  Members of the above groups will receive a rapid test. People who take a rapid test and receive a positive result will be called directly within two hours by the Chief Public Health Office.  Anyone who has a positive rapid test will be re-directed to a testing clinic to have a confirmatory PCR test.   Those who do not receive a call within two hours are considered to have a negative result.   All those tested will receive a card showing the date and time of their test. Employers who require proof of testing before allowing an employee to work following travel may refer to the testing card, noting the time of the test.   Travelers who arrive via the airport will be given instructions for testing when they arrive and will receive tests at the 64 Park Street testing clinic in Charlottetown, the Slemon Park testing clinic or one of the other testing clinics across the province.  https://archive.vn/NZvQn#selection-2167.0-2206.0  https://archive.vn/NZvQn"

Eligibility for all phases is based on the age you are turning in 2021; however, on March 29th this age eligibility was changed when pharmacy’s started to vaccinate 55-65 year old’s on a first come first serve basis. In Phase 3 of the immunization plan. Vaccines will primarily be distributed by age, starting with the oldest.    The broadening of the age groups came as a surprise as the National Advisory Council on Immunization’s recommendation that provinces pause giving the AstraZeneca vaccine to people under the age of 55 so more work can be done to investigate cases of rare and unusual blood clotting. Therefore, doses intended for front-line workers under 55 were reprioritized for those 55 to 65. These rules have shifted to allow for over 40s to get the AstraZeneca vaccine as of April 20th 2021.
