The conditions in the classroom continue to be significantly different than normal with mask wearing and hygiene measures in place.    With COVID-19 variants in several B.C. schools, calls have been growing to see if the province will allow school districts to go above and beyond provincial guidelines for physical distancing and safety. People want more rapid testing once a variant is detected at a school, as well as improved ventilation, and a mask mandate for young kids. However, the suggestion of a school district wanting to go beyond what the province is recommending didn’t get support from the education minister.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210307193813/https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/covid-19-safe-schools"

Furthermore, indoor gatherings outside of dwellings, such as group counselling or support groups are specifically restricted to 10. As we code the most stringent policy, this has therefore been coded as 4T. A side note, the Government also recommends that those in Arviat create bubbles of 2 households.    In all other areas of Nunavut (Chesterfield Inlet, Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Naujaat, Rankin Inlet,  Whale Cove, Baffin, and Kitikmeot), outdoor gatherings are restricted to 100 people, while indoor gatherings are restricted to a household plus 15 people.

It outlines Ontario's plan to support families, workers and employers.    “The necessary public health measures have come at a cost for workers, families and business owners, but there is no question that they have saved lives,” said Minister Bethlenfalvy. “We recognize the sacrifices that have been made. We are taking further steps to provide additional relief and support to those who have been most impacted by the pandemic, including providing a third round of direct payments to parents, doubling the Ontario Small Business Support Grant, and helping workers with their training expenses.”    Highlights of Ontario's plan to support workers and families:    To help workers with their training expenses, the government is proposing a new Ontario Jobs Training Tax Credit for 2021. It would provide up to $2,000 per recipient for 50 per cent of eligible expenses, for a total of an estimated $260 million in support to about 230,000 people in 2021.  To help families — who have faced new pressures and expenses due to the pandemic — keep more money in their pockets, the government is providing a third round of payments to support parents through the Ontario COVID-19 Child Benefit, totalling $1.8 billion since last March. The payment will be doubled to $400 per child for this round and $500 for each child with special needs, which means a family with three young children, one of whom has special needs, will receive $2,600 in total after the third round of payments.  To support parents with the cost of child care and help them get back to the workforce, the government is proposing a 20 per cent enhancement of the CARE tax credit for 2021. This would increase support from $1,250 to $1,500, on average, providing about  $75 million in additional support for the child care expenses of over 300,000 families.  Highlights of Ontario's plan to support jobs:    To help small businesses that have been most affected by the necessary restrictions to protect people from COVID-19, Ontario is providing a second round of Ontario Small Business Support Grant payments to eligible recipients. Approximately 120,000 small businesses will automatically benefit from an additional $1.7 billion in relief through this second round of support in the form of grants of a minimum of $10,000 and up to $20,000 — bringing the estimated total support provided through this grant to $3.4 billion.  To support Ontario's tourism, hospitality and culture industries that have been among the most heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario is investing an additional $400 million over the next three years in new initiatives to support these sectors. This builds on previously announced investments of $225 million, bringing the total to more than $625 million since the pandemic began.  To connect homes, businesses and communities to broadband — which COVID-19 has demonstrated is a necessity, not a luxury — Ontario is investing $2.8 billion, bringing the Province's total investment to nearly $4 billion over six years beginning 2019–20.  Highlights of Ontario's plan to support communities:    To support faith-based and cultural organizations that are struggling due to the additional costs caused by COVID-19, Ontario will be making up to $50 million available for grants to eligible organizations.  To support Ontario's 444 municipalities, the Province's key partners in the fight against COVID-19, the government is providing almost $1 billion in additional financial relief in 2021 to help preserve vital public services and support economic recovery.""""
