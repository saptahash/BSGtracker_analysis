Employers must ensure that workers are prohibited from entering the workplace if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or have had a potential exposure through a health check.    Employers must encourage workers to work from their private residence wherever possible, unless there is a preference on the part of the worker or the employer for the worker to work at the workplace.    COVID-19 Safety Plans must include measures to prevent workers from congregating or crowding in indoor common areas, such as elevators, lobbies, hallways, stairwells, corridors, bathrooms, meeting rooms, break rooms, and kitchens.

The pilot would allow them to receive their first test at the airport. The requirement to follow isolation protocols following travel into Prince Edward Island remains in place.    The Chief Public Health Office and Health PEI will run the pilot project for a four week period at the Charlottetown Airport, offering PoC COVID screening to arriving travelers beginning on Tuesday, February 23. Two swabs will be provided, one PoC and one lab test for confirmation. By participating in the pilot testing project, travelers arriving by air can be swabbed for their first test at the airport. Participants in the pilot study who are required to get tested again at days 4-6 and 9-11 after arrival will be able to access the additional testing at one of PEI’s drop-in testing clinics.     “The process of testing at the airport will make testing more convenient and faster for any incoming travelers,” said Charlottetown Airport CEO, Doug Newson. “We are very pleased to work with the Chief Public Health Office, Health PEI and Island EMS to provide this service to simplify testing for incoming travelers while also helping to control the importation and spread of COVID-19.”    PoC tests have been used in PEI to support targeted testing of 20 to 29 year olds and testing among members of the province’s homeless population. These rapid tests would also be used as part of an outbreak response.

Dec. 30 is the first day Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is available for First Nations communities in the province. This is because Dr. Henry states that """"“As soon as [Moderna] arrives, it will be going to a number of remote and isolated First Nations communities that have been identified”.

As well, BC is planning to start mass vaccinations in March 2021, with the over 80's being the first to be vaccinated. Dr. Henry provided an update on B.C.'s vaccination program, which has been delayed by a lack of supply from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and confirmed fresh doses are now on their way so the province is on track to begin mass immunization clinics in March.
